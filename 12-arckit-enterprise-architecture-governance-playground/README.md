# ArcKit - Enterprise Architecture Governance Toolkit

What is ArcKit?

⁠⁠ArcKit is a free, open-source toolkit for enterprise architects that transforms architecture governance from scattered documents into a systematic, AI-assisted workflow. It works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI to generate⁠⁠:

⁠⁠Architecture principles and stakeholder analysis
Risk registers (HM Treasury Orange Book)
Business cases (HM Treasury Green Book SOBC)
Requirements documents with full traceability
Wardley Maps for strategic planning
Vendor procurement documentation (G-Cloud, DOS)
Design review packs (HLD/DLD)
UK Government compliance assessments (GDS Service Standard, TCoP, NCSC CAF)
MOD-specific documentation (JSP 440, JSP 936, IAMM)⁠⁠


What ArcKit does

46 slash commands that generate enterprise architecture artifacts — requirements specs, risk registers, business cases, DPIAs, Wardley maps, vendor evaluations, and more. Template-driven, UK Government standards aligned (GDS, TCoP, NCSC CAF, Green/Orange Book), with full traceability from stakeholders through to sprint backlogs.
Built for enterprise architects who want systematic, AI-assisted governance.
