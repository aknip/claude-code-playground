## Specs => ShadCN

I want to build a modern web interface using ShadCN components.Goal:
- A login page with standard email/password authentication.
- After login, a dashboard displays a grid of cards — each representing an MCP server.
- Clicking a card opens a detailed view with:
  - A header image
  - Metadata (name, status, region, version)
  - Installation steps shown as bubble cards or collapsible UIPlease generate an implementation plan:
- List the key components and pages to build
- Suggest how to structure the project modularly
- Recommend the tools/hooks/layout strategies to use for optimal UX




## Plan => ShadCN

create a simple todo app.

Your task:
- Identify which ShadCN components should be used in the interface
- Map each component to its appropriate place in the Ul structure
- Do NOT include any actual code only list the **component names** and **where they belong**

This is a planning step only. Focus on structure and component placement, not implementation.
