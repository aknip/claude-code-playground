# Command: /uc:new-milestone

## Purpose

Start a new milestone cycle (e.g., v2.0.0) after completing the previous milestone. Prepares the project structure for new development while preserving project vision and actors.

## When to Use

- After completing a milestone with `/uc:complete-milestone`
- Ready to start planning next version (v2.0.0, v3.0.0, etc.)
- Want to begin a new development cycle with fresh phases

## Prerequisites

- Previous milestone should be completed (optional but recommended)
- Previous milestone should be archived
- Clean git state (no uncommitted changes)

## Usage

```bash
/uc:new-milestone [--version X.Y.Z] [--interactive] [--description "text"]
```

### Flags

- `--version X.Y.Z`: Specify new version number (default: auto-increment from previous)
- `--interactive`: Run guided questioning session for v2 goals
- `--description "text"`: Brief description of new milestone goals

## What This Command Does

### 1. Check Prerequisites

Validates readiness for new milestone:

```
Checking prerequisites...
✓ Previous milestone v1.0.0 completed
✓ Milestone archive exists
✓ Git state is clean
✓ Ready for new milestone
```

### 2. Determine Version

Determines new version number:
- Uses `--version` flag if provided
- Auto-increments major version from previous (v1.0.0 → v2.0.0)
- Prompts user if needed

### 3. Create Fresh Structure

Creates clean structure for new milestone:

```
Creating new milestone structure...

Creating:
   .planning/phases/           # Fresh, empty phases directory
```

Preserving:
   .planning/PROJECT.md        # Actors and vision preserved
   .planning/use-cases/        # Use case infrastructure (reset tracking)
   .planning/config.json       # Configuration settings
```

### 4. Reset STATE.md

Resets STATE.md for new milestone tracking:

```markdown
# Project State

**Current Milestone:** v2.0.0
**Started:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Planning

---

## Current Phase

None (milestone planning in progress)

## Recent Activity

```

### 6. Update PROJECT.md

Adds milestone section to PROJECT.md (if not exists):

```markdown
## Previous Milestones

### v1.0.0 - User Management System
**Completed:** 2026-01-27
**Archive:** `.planning/milestones/v1.0.0/`
**Tag:** v1.0.0

---

## Current Milestone

**Version:** v2.0.0
**Started:** 2026-01-28
**Goal:** [To be defined]
```

### 7. Optional: Interactive Goal Definition

If `--interactive` flag is used, prompts for v2 goals:

```
🎯 Define v2.0.0 Goals

What are the main goals for this milestone?

Examples:
- Add new major feature
- Enhance existing functionality
- Refactor architecture
- Performance improvements

Your goals (or press Enter to skip):
> Add payment processing and subscription management

Any specific features or capabilities? (Enter to skip)
> Stripe integration, subscription tiers, billing history

✅ Goals captured. These will be added to PROJECT.md.

Next Steps:
   1. Run /uc:add-phase to add phases for v2
   2. Or run /uc:new-project --milestone to do full use case analysis for v2
```

### 8. Clean Use Case Tracking

Resets use case tracking for new milestone:
- Keeps use case directory structure
- Clears completion status from previous milestone
- Keeps index.md but marks previous use cases as "v1"
- Ready for new use cases to be added

## Output Example

```
🚀 Starting New Milestone v2.0.0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
PREREQUISITES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Previous milestone: v1.0.0 (completed 2026-01-27)
✅ Archive exists: .planning/milestones/v1.0.0/
✅ Git state: clean
✅ Ready for new milestone

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NEW MILESTONE: v2.0.0
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📝 Version: v2.0.0
📅 Started: 2026-01-28
📄 Description: Payment and Subscription System

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SETUP COMPLETE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Created fresh phases/ directory
✅ Preserved PROJECT.md (actors and vision)
✅ Reset STATE.md for v2
✅ Updated ROADMAP.md
✅ Reset use case tracking

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
NEXT STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Choose your approach:

1️⃣  Add phases manually:
   /uc:add-phase payment-integration
   /uc:add-phase subscription-management

2️⃣  Full use case analysis for v2:
   /uc:new-project --milestone
   (Runs questioning session for v2 features)

3️⃣  Plan incrementally:
   Start with one phase, plan more as you go

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Previous Milestone:
   v1.0.0 → Archived in .planning/milestones/v1.0.0/

Ready to build v2.0.0! 🚀
```

## Non-Interactive Mode

Without `--interactive`:

```
🚀 Starting Milestone v2.0.0

✅ Setup Complete:
   - Created fresh phases/ directory
   - Reset STATE.md for v2.0.0
   - Updated ROADMAP.md
   - Preserved PROJECT.md

Next Steps:
   1. Add phases: /uc:add-phase [name]
   2. Or run: /uc:new-milestone --interactive
   3. View progress: /uc:progress

Previous Milestone: v1.0.0 (archived)
```

## Error Handling

If prerequisites not met:

```
⚠️  Cannot Start New Milestone

Issues:
   ❌ Previous milestone (v1.0.0) not completed
   ⚠️  No milestone archive found

Recommendations:
   1. Complete current milestone: /uc:complete-milestone
   2. Or force new milestone: /uc:new-milestone --force

Note: Using --force will start v2 without completing v1.
      Previous work remains in phases/ directory (not archived).
```

## Version Numbering

Automatic version increment:
- v1.0.0 → v2.0.0 (increment major)
- v2.0.0 → v3.0.0 (increment major)

Custom version:
```bash
/uc:new-milestone --version 2.1.0
```

## What is Preserved

**Preserved across milestones:**
- PROJECT.md (actors, vision, business context)
- .claude/ directory (agents, commands, skills)
- config.json (settings)
- Git repository and history

**Reset for new milestone:**
- phases/ directory (emptied, ready for v2 phases)
- STATE.md (reset with v2 header)
- ROADMAP.md (v2 section, v1 moved to history)
- Use case completion tracking (structure preserved)

**Archived from v1:**
- All phase directories
- All use case documents
- Verification results
- State snapshots

## Related Commands

- `/uc:complete-milestone` - Complete current milestone before starting new one
- `/uc:add-phase` - Add phases to new milestone
- `/uc:audit-milestone` - Check v1 completeness before v2
- `/uc:progress` - View milestone progress

## Files Modified

- `.planning/STATE.md` - Reset for v2
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` - Add v2 section, archive v1
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` - Add milestone history section
- `.planning/phases/` - Emptied for fresh start

## Files Created

None (resets existing structure)

## Implementation Details

This command should:

1. Check prerequisites (previous milestone complete, archive exists)
2. Determine new version (auto-increment or from flag)
3. Create clean phases/ directory (move old to archive if not already done)
4. Reset STATE.md with v2 header and preserve milestone history
5. Update ROADMAP.md with v2 section and move v1 to history
6. Update PROJECT.md with milestone section
7. Reset use case tracking (keep structure, clear completion)
8. If `--interactive`, run goal definition prompts
9. Display next steps clearly

The implementation should:
- **Preserve continuity:** Keep PROJECT.md actors and vision
- **Safe reset:** Don't delete v1 work (should be archived already)
- **Clear state:** Make it obvious we're in v2 planning mode
- **Flexible start:** Support both manual phase addition and full use case analysis
