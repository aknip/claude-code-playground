# Command: /uc:resume-work

## Purpose

Resume work from a paused session. Loads captured context, displays current state, and helps you pick up where you left off.

## When to Use

- Starting work after using `/uc:pause-work`
- Returning to project after break
- Switching back from another project
- Handoff from another developer
- After system restart

## Prerequisites

- At least one paused session exists (from `/uc:pause-work`)

## Usage

```bash
/uc:resume-work [session-id] [--continue] [--list]
```

### Arguments

- `session-id`: Specific session to resume (default: most recent)

### Flags

- `--continue`: Automatically continue work after loading context
- `--list`: Just list available sessions without resuming

## What This Command Does

### 1. List Sessions (if no ID provided)

Shows available paused sessions:
- Session ID and timestamp
- Phase and task
- Tag and message
- Time since pause

### 2. Load Session File

Reads session state document:
- Work context
- Progress status
- Git state at time of pause
- Blockers/questions
- Next actions

### 3. Compare Current State

Checks if state has changed:
- Git branch matches?
- Last commit matches?
- Uncommitted files changed?
- New commits added?

### 4. Display Context

Shows detailed session info:
- What was being worked on
- Progress percentage
- Open questions
- Next steps

### 5. Optional: Continue Work

With `--continue` flag, automatically:
- Updates STATE.md (remove PAUSED marker)
- Sets up for continuation
- Executes first recommended command (if safe)

## Output Example (No Session ID)

```bash
/uc:resume-work
```

```

## List Mode

```bash
/uc:resume-work --list
```

Shows available sessions without resuming (same as output when no session-id provided).

## State Mismatch Warning

If state changed significantly:

```
⚠️  State Mismatch Detected

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DIFFERENCES FROM SESSION STATE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ Git branch changed:
   At pause: phase-02-user-auth
   Now: main

⚠️  New commits since pause: 5 commits
   xyz123a: feat(02-01): complete UC-SF-007 Login Form
   (and 4 more...)

⚠️  Uncommitted changes differ:
   At pause: src/components/LoginForm.tsx
   Now: src/components/ProfileView.tsx

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  Warning: Significant state changes detected!

Possible scenarios:
   1. Work continued without this session (perhaps by other dev)
   2. Branch was switched
   3. Commits were made directly

Recommendations:
   1. Review git log to understand changes
   2. Check if work from session is already complete
   3. Consider merging changes if needed

Continue with resume? (y/n):
```

## Branch Switched

If on different branch:

```
⚠️  Branch Mismatch

Session was on branch: phase-02-user-auth
Currently on branch: main

Options:
   1. Switch back to session branch:
      git checkout phase-02-user-auth

   2. Continue on current branch (not recommended)

   3. Cancel resume

Options:
   1. Load context anyway (for reference)
   2. Resume from different session: /uc:resume-work --list

```
ℹ️  Multiple Sessions from Same Point

Sessions 2 and 3 both paused from:
   - Phase: 02-user-authentication
   - Commit: abc123f
   - Time: within 1 hour

These may be duplicate sessions.
Recommend resuming the most recent: 20260127_163045
```

## Quick Resume (Most Recent)

```bash
/uc:resume-work
```

Without prompts, automatically loads and displays most recent session.

## Session Metadata Display

Each session shows:

```

- `/uc:debug` - Diagnose issues

## Files Modified

- `.planning/STATE.md` - Remove PAUSED marker (if continuing)

## Files Read

- `.planning/sessions/[session-id]_pause.md` - Session state
- Current git status - For comparison
- `.planning/STATE.md` - Current project state

## Implementation Details

This command should:

1. **List sessions** - If no ID provided, show available sessions
2. **Load session file** - Read and parse session markdown
3. **Get current state** - Check current git status, branch, commits
4. **Compare states** - Detect changes since pause
5. **Display context** - Show all relevant information clearly
6. **Handle mismatches** - Warn about state changes, offer solutions
7. **Optional continue** - Update STATE.md if user chooses to continue
8. **Smart defaults** - Auto-select most recent if appropriate

The implementation should:
- **Be helpful:** Clearly explain what changed since pause
- **Be safe:** Warn about significant state changes
- **Be flexible:** Allow resuming old sessions even if state changed
- **Be fast:** Load and display within 2-3 seconds
- **Be informative:** Show enough context to quickly orient
