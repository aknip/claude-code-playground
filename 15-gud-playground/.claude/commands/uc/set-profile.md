# Command: /uc:set-profile

## Purpose

Quick command to change the model profile. Faster than using `/uc:settings --edit` when you only want to adjust quality/cost trade-off.

## When to Use

- Switching between quality and cost modes
- Starting production-critical project (use `quality`)
- Prototyping or learning (use `budget`)
- Most projects (use `balanced`)

## Prerequisites

None - can run anytime

## Usage

```bash
/uc:set-profile [quality|balanced|budget]
```

### Arguments

- Profile name: `quality`, `balanced`, or `budget` (required)

## Model Profiles Explained

### quality - Best Quality, Highest Cost

**Use Case:** Production-critical projects, complex domains, high stakes

**Agent Assignments:**
- **Opus:** uc-analyst, uc-modeler, uc-planner, uc-verifier, uc-checker, uc-phase-researcher
- **Sonnet:** uc-executor, uc-brownfield-mapper

**Benefits:**
- Highest quality analysis and planning
- Better pattern detection and recommendations
- More thorough verification
- Fewer misunderstandings

**Cost:** ~3x baseline (mostly Opus usage)

---

### balanced - Good Balance ⚖️

**Use Case:** Most projects, good quality at reasonable cost (DEFAULT)

**Agent Assignments:**
- **Opus:** uc-modeler, uc-planner
- **Sonnet:** uc-analyst, uc-executor, uc-verifier, uc-checker, uc-phase-researcher, uc-brownfield-mapper

**Benefits:**
- Good quality for planning (Opus)
- Cost-effective for execution (Sonnet)
- Best default for most projects

**Cost:** ~1.5x baseline

---

### budget - Cost Optimized

**Use Case:** Prototyping, learning, experimentation, non-critical projects

**Agent Assignments:**
- **Sonnet:** All agents

**Benefits:**
- Lowest cost
- Still high quality (Sonnet is excellent)
- Fast response times

**Cost:** ~1x baseline (Sonnet only)

**Trade-offs:**
- Planning may be less nuanced
- Verification may catch fewer edge cases
- Pattern detection may miss subtleties

## Output Example (No Arguments)

```bash
/uc:set-profile
```

```

   Increase: ~3x total cost

Quality improvements:
   ✅ Much better planning and roadmap creation
   ✅ Better pattern detection and recommendations
   ✅ More thorough verification
   ✅ Fewer overlooked edge cases

Recommended for:
   ✅ Production-critical projects
   ✅ Complex business domains

## Mid-Project Warning

If changing profile during active project:

```
⚠️  Mid-Project Profile Change

Current phase in progress: 02-user-authentication

Changing profile will affect:
   ✅ Future agent executions
   ❌ Already-executed work (unchanged)

This can cause inconsistency in planning/execution style.

Recommendations:
   1. Complete current phase before changing
   2. Document profile change in STATE.md
   3. Continue with new profile

Continue anyway? (y/n):
```

## Configuration File

Updates `.planning/config.json`:

```json
{
  "model_profile": "quality",
  "agents": {
    "uc-analyst": { "model": "opus" },
    "uc-modeler": { "model": "opus" },
    "uc-planner": { "model": "opus" },
    "uc-executor": { "model": "sonnet" },
    "uc-verifier": { "model": "opus" },
    "uc-checker": { "model": "opus" },
    "uc-phase-researcher": { "model": "opus" },
    "uc-brownfield-mapper": { "model": "sonnet" }
  }
}
```

## Profile Selection Guide

**Choose `quality` if:**
- Production/critical application
- Complex business domain
- High user count / high stakes
- Budget allows premium models
- Quality is priority over cost

**Choose `balanced` if:**
- Most projects (default)
- Good quality needed but cost-conscious
- Standard business application
- Team/startup with limited budget

**Choose `budget` if:**
- Learning/experimenting with framework
- Prototyping
- Non-critical application
- Very cost-sensitive
- High volume of API calls expected

## Implementation Details

This command should:

1. **Parse argument** - Get profile name or prompt if missing
2. **Validate profile** - Must be quality/balanced/budget
3. **Load current settings** - Read .planning/config.json
4. **Show comparison** - Display current vs new assignments
5. **Calculate impact** - Show cost and quality changes
6. **Confirm change** - Require user confirmation (unless --force)
7. **Update config** - Write new profile and agent assignments
8. **Display summary** - Confirm changes saved

The implementation should:
- **Be fast** - Single-purpose command, complete quickly
- **Be informative** - Clearly explain impact of change
- **Be safe** - Confirm before making changes (unless --force)
- **Update atomically** - Don't corrupt config if save fails
