  Why It Didn't Activate

  The Skill tool I have access to shows an empty <available_skills> section, which suggests:

  1. Skills may need a Claude Code restart to be detected
  2. The skill activation is contextual - Claude should automatically apply the skill's guidance when the
  task matches, rather than you explicitly invoking it

  To Verify

  Try restarting Claude Code, then ask:
  What skills are available in this project?

  Or simply make a request that matches the skill description:
  Update the README to reflect recent changes

  Claude should then automatically incorporate the skill's instructions when relevant.
