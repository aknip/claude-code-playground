# 1. Write

Start With a Script

---
layout: section
---

# Tell Your Story

The heart of a great presentation is the message. Get the script right before anything else.

---
layout: v-split
---

# Write it

Think about what you want to achieve. Then write it down like an email.

::right::

# Or Paste it

From DMs to articles, any existing text can become a presentation in no time. Paste your instant messages, a work chat, or a Mastodon thread.

---
layout: v-split
---

# Use Placeholder Images

You will be tempted to add images while writing. Resist the temptation. To move fast, use placeholders. Search, choose and place images with the same concentration as a separate task.

# 2. Structure

Separating What You Say and What You Show

---
layout: v-split
---

# Chop Chop

Type three dashes to split your story up into slides, like this: ---

# Don't show everything

Make it interesting. Show words and images that make people listen. Don't explain what everyone already sees.

<div class="grid-item">

</div>

<div class="grid-item">

## Headings

Headings are always visible, so make them short, clear, and interesting.

</div>

<div class="grid-item">
  <img src="./images/image2.webp" alt="body text" style="height: 140px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 6px; width: 100%;" />
</div>

<div class="grid-item">

## Body Text

To make a paragraph of plain text visible on the slide add a tab in front of the paragraph.

</div>

<div class="grid-item">
  <img src="./images/image3.webp" alt="visuals" style="height: 140px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 6px; width: 100%;" />
</div>

<div class="grid-item">

## Visuals

Images, videos, and tables are shown by default. Images can be fine-tuned using filters, positioning, etc.

</div>

layout: default

**Most people don't like stuffed slides.** Sometimes, you need to show more on a slide. You may want to discuss a whole paragraph of text. But if you do, be careful. No one likes having slides read aloud word-for-word. We read faster than we can speak, so we get bored hearing what we have already read. Don't do to your audience what you wouldn't want done to you.

# 3. Iterate

---
layout: v-split
