![line image](images/img_005.jpg)

How is a vision turned into a plan that becomes a triumphant new
reality?

Let me tell you a story. You may have heard about it, particularly if
you live in California. If you do, you're paying for it.

In 2008, Golden State voters were asked to imagine themselves at Union
Station in downtown Los Angeles, on board a sleek silver train.
Departing the station, the train slips quietly through the urban sprawl
and endless traffic jams and accelerates as it enters the open spaces of
the Central Valley, until the countryside is racing by in a blur.
Breakfast is served. By the time attendants clear coffee cups and
plates, the train slows and glides into another station. This is
downtown San Francisco. The whole trip took two and a half hours, not
much more than the time it would take the average Los Angeleno to drive
to the airport, clear security, and get on a plane to queue on the
tarmac, waiting for departure. The cost of the train ticket was \$86.

The project was called California High-Speed Rail. It would connect two
of the world's great cities, along with Silicon Valley, the global
capital of high technology. Words such as *visionary* are used too
liberally, but this really was visionary. And for a total cost of \$33
billion it would be ready to roll by
2020.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_1){#intro.xhtml_not_1}^ In a statewide
referendum, Californians approved. Work began.

As I write, it is now fourteen years later. Much about the project
remains uncertain, but we can be sure that the end result will not be
what was promised.

[]{#intro.xhtml_Page_x .pagebreak aria-label="x"
role="doc-pagebreak"}After voters approved the project, construction
started at various points along the route, but the project was hit with
constant delays. Plans were changed repeatedly. Cost estimates soared,
to \$43 billion, \$68 billion, \$77 billion, then almost \$83 billion.
As I write, the current highest estimate is \$100
billion.^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_2){#intro.xhtml_not_2}^ But the truth is
that nobody knows what the full, final cost will be.

In 2019, California's governor announced that the state would complete
only part of the route: the 171-mile section between the towns of Merced
and Bakersfield, in California's Central Valley, at an estimated cost of
\$23 billion. But when that inland section is completed, the project
will stop. It will be up to some future governor to decide whether to
launch the project again and, if so, figure out how to get the roughly
\$80 billion---or whatever the number will be by then---to extend the
tracks and finally connect Los Angeles and San
Francisco.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_3){#intro.xhtml_not_3}^

For perspective, consider that the cost of the line between only Merced
and Bakersfield is the same as or more than the annual gross domestic
product of Honduras, Iceland, and about a hundred other countries. And
that money will build the most sophisticated rail line in North America
between two towns most people outside California have never heard of. It
will be---as critics put it---the "bullet train to nowhere."

How do visions become plans that deliver successful projects? Not like
this. An ambitious vision is a wonderful thing. California was bold. It
dreamed big. But even with buckets of money, a vision is not enough.

Let me tell you another story. This one is unknown, but I think it gets
us closer to the answers we need.

In the early 1990s, Danish officials had an idea. Denmark is a small
country with a population less than New York City's, but it is rich and
gives a lot of money in foreign aid and wants that money to do good. Few
things do more good than education. The Danish officials got together
with colleagues from other governments and agreed to fund a school
system for the Himalayan nation of Nepal. Twenty thousand
[]{#intro.xhtml_Page_xi .pagebreak aria-label="xi"
role="doc-pagebreak"}schools and classrooms would be built, most of them
in the poorest and most remote regions. Work would begin in 1992. It
would take twenty years.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_4){#intro.xhtml_not_4}^

The history of foreign aid is littered with boondoggles, and this
project could easily have added to the mess. Yet it finished on budget
in 2004---eight years ahead of schedule. In the years that followed,
educational levels rose across the country, with a long list of positive
consequences, particularly a jump in the number of girls in classrooms.
The schools even saved lives: When a massive earthquake struck Nepal in
2015, almost nine thousand people died, with many being crushed to death
in collapsing buildings. But the schools had been designed to be
earthquake proof, as a first. They stood. Today, the Bill & Melinda
Gates Foundation uses the project as an exemplar of how to improve
health by increasing enrollment in schools, particularly for
girls.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_5){#intro.xhtml_not_5}^

I was the planner on that
project.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_6){#intro.xhtml_not_6}^ At the time, I
was pleased with how it turned out, but I didn't think much about it. It
was my first big project, and, after all, we only did what we had said
we would do: turn a vision into a plan that was delivered as promised.

However, in addition to being a planner, I am an academic, and the more
I studied how big projects come together---or fail to---the more I
understood that my experience in Nepal was not normal. In fact, it was
not remotely normal. As we'll see, the data show that big projects that
deliver as promised are rare. Normal looks a lot more like California
High-Speed Rail. Average practice is a disaster, best practice an
outlier, as I would later point out in my findings about megaproject
management.^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_7){#intro.xhtml_not_7}^

Why is the track record of big projects so bad? Even more important,
what about the rare, tantalizing exceptions? Why do they succeed where
so many others fail? Had we just been lucky delivering the schools in
Nepal? Or could we do it again? As a professor of planning and
management, I've spent many years answering those questions.
[]{#intro.xhtml_Page_xii .pagebreak aria-label="xii"
role="doc-pagebreak"}As a consultant, I've spent many years putting my
answers into practice. In this book, I'm putting them into print.

The focus of my work is megaprojects---*very* big projects---and lots of
things about that category are special. Navigation of national politics
and global bond markets, for example, is not something the average home
remodeler has to contend with. But that stuff is for another book. What
I'm interested in here are the drivers of project failure and success
that are universal. That explains the title. *How Big Things Get Done*
is a nod to my expertise in megaprojects, which are big by anyone's
standards. But "big" is relative. For average homeowners, a home
remodeling can easily be one of the most expensive, complex, challenging
projects they ever tackle. Getting it right means as much or more to
them as the fate of megaprojects means to corporations and governments.
It is absolutely a "big thing."

So what are the universal drivers that make the difference between
success and failure?

### [PSYCHOLOGY AND POWER]{.sans} {.author-head1}

One driver is psychology. In any big project---meaning a project that is
considered big, complex, ambitious, and risky by those in
charge---people think, make judgments, and make decisions. And where
there are thinking, judgment, and decisions, psychology is at play; for
instance, in the guise of optimism.

Another driver is power. In any big project people and organizations
compete for resources and jockey for position. Where there are
competition and jockeying, there is power; for instance, that of a CEO
or politician pushing through a pet project.

Psychology and power drive projects at all scales, from skyscrapers to
kitchen renovations. They are present in projects made of bricks and
mortar, bits and bytes, or any other medium. They are found whenever
someone is excited by a vision and wants to turn it into a
[]{#intro.xhtml_Page_xiii .pagebreak aria-label="xiii"
role="doc-pagebreak"}plan and make that plan a reality---whether the
vision is to place another jewel in the Manhattan skyline or launch a
new business, go to Mars, invent a new product, change an organization,
design a program, convene a conference, write a book, host a family
wedding, or renovate and transform a home.

With universal drivers at work, we can expect there to be patterns in
how projects of all types unfold. And there are. The most common is
perfectly illustrated by California's bullet train to nowhere.

The project was approved, and work began in a rush of excitement. But
problems soon proliferated. Progress slowed. More problems arose. Things
slowed further. The project dragged on and on. I call this pattern
"Think fast, act slow," for reasons I'll explain later. It is a hallmark
of failed projects.

Successful projects, by contrast, tend to follow the opposite pattern
and advance quickly to the finish line. That's how the Nepal schools
project unfolded. So did the Hoover Dam, which was completed a little
under budget in fewer than five years---two ahead of
schedule.^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_8){#intro.xhtml_not_8}^ Boeing took
twenty-eight months to design and build the first of its iconic
747s.^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_9){#intro.xhtml_not_9}^ Apple hired the
first employee to work on what would become the legendary iPod in late
January 2001, the project was formally approved in March 2001, and the
first iPod was shipped to customers in November
2001.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_10){#intro.xhtml_not_10}^ Amazon Prime, the
online retailer's enormously successful membership and free shipping
program, went from a vague idea to a public announcement between October
2004 and February 2005.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_11){#intro.xhtml_not_11}^
The first SMS texting app was developed in just a few weeks.

Then there's the Empire State Building.

### [A NEW YORK SUCCESS STORY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The vision that became arguably the world's most legendary skyscraper
started with a pencil. Who held the pencil depends on which
[]{#intro.xhtml_Page_xiv .pagebreak aria-label="xiv"
role="doc-pagebreak"}version of the story you trust. In one, it was the
architect, William Lamb. In another, it was John J. Raskob, a financial
wizard and former General Motors executive. In either case, a pencil was
taken from a desk and held vertically, point up. That's what the Empire
State Building would be: slim, straight, and stretching higher into the
sky than any other building on the
planet.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_12){#intro.xhtml_not_12}^

The idea to erect a tower probably came early in 1929 from Al Smith. A
lifelong New Yorker and former New York governor, Smith had been the
Democratic presidential candidate in the 1928 election. Like most New
Yorkers, Smith opposed Prohibition. Most Americans disagreed, and Smith
lost to Herbert Hoover. Unemployed, Smith needed a new challenge. He
took his idea to Raskob, and they formed Empire State Inc., with Smith
acting as the president and face of the corporation and Raskob as its
moneyman. They settled on a location---the site of the original
Waldorf-Astoria hotel, once the pinnacle of Manhattan luxury---set the
parameters of the project, and developed the business plan. They fixed
the total budget, including the purchase and demolition of the
Waldorf-Astoria, at \$50 million (\$820 million in 2021 dollars), and
scheduled the grand opening for May 1, 1931. They hired Lamb's firm.
Someone held up a pencil. At that point, they had eighteen months to go
from first sketch to last rivet.

They moved fast because the moment was right. In the late 1920s, New
York had overtaken London as the world's most populous metropolis, jazz
was hot, stocks were soaring, the economy was booming, and
skyscrapers---the thrilling new symbol of prosperous Machine Age
America---were leaping up all over Manhattan. Financiers were looking
for new projects to back, the more ambitious the better. The Chrysler
Building would soon become the tallest of the titans, garnering all the
prestige and rental income that went with the title. Raskob, Smith, and
Lamb were determined to have their pencil top them all.

[]{#intro.xhtml_Page_xv .pagebreak aria-label="xv"
role="doc-pagebreak"}In planning the building, Lamb's focus was
intensely practical. "The day that \[the architect\] could sit before
his drawing board and make pretty sketches of decidedly uneconomic
monuments to himself has gone," he wrote in January 1931. "His scorn of
things 'practical' has been replaced by an intense earnestness to make
practical necessities the armature upon which he moulds the form of his
idea."

Working closely with the project's builders and engineers, Lamb
developed designs shaped by the site and the need to stay on budget and
schedule. "The adaptation of the design to conditions of use,
construction and speed of erection has been kept to the fore throughout
the development of the drawings of the Empire State," he wrote. The
designs were rigorously tested to ensure that they would work. "Hardly a
detail was issued without having been thoroughly analyzed by the
builders and their experts and adjusted and changed to meet every
foreseen delay."^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_13){#intro.xhtml_not_13}^

In a 1931 publication, the corporation boasted that before any work had
been done on the construction site "the architects knew exactly how many
beams and of what lengths, even how many rivets and bolts would be
needed. They knew how many windows Empire State would have, how many
blocks of limestone, and of what shapes and sizes, how many tons of
aluminum and stainless steel, tons of cement, tons of mortar. Even
before it was begun, Empire State was finished entirely---on
paper."^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_14){#intro.xhtml_not_14}^

The first steam shovel clawed into the Manhattan dirt on March 17, 1930.
More than three thousand workers swarmed the site, and construction
advanced rapidly, beginning with the steel skeleton thrusting upward,
followed by the completed first story. Then the second story. The third.
The fourth. Newspapers reported on the skyscraper's rise as if it were a
Yankees playoff run.

As workers learned and processes smoothed, progress accelerated. Up went
three stories in one week. Four. Four and a half. At the height of
construction, the pace hit a story a
day.^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_15){#intro.xhtml_not_15}^ And a little more.
[]{#intro.xhtml_Page_xvi .pagebreak aria-label="xvi"
role="doc-pagebreak"}"When we were in full swing going up the main
tower," Lamb's partner Richmond Shreve recalled, "things clicked with
such precision that once we erected fourteen and a half floors in ten
working days---steel, concrete, stone and
all."^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_16){#intro.xhtml_not_16}^ That was an era
when people marveled at the efficiency of factories churning out cars,
and the Empire State designers were inspired to imagine their process as
a vertical assembly line---except that "the assembly line did the
moving," Shreve explained, while "the finished product stayed in
place."^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_17){#intro.xhtml_not_17}^

By the time the Empire State Building was officially opened by President
Herbert Hoover---exactly as scheduled, on May 1, 1931---it was already a
local and national celebrity. Its height was daunting. The efficiency of
its construction was legendary. And even though practicality had been at
the front of Lamb's mind, the building was unmistakably beautiful.
Lamb's drive for efficiency had created a lean, elegant design, and the
New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded it the
1931 Medal of Honor.^[18](#notes.xhtml#note_18){#intro.xhtml_not_18}^
Then, in 1933, King Kong climbed the building on the silver screen while
clutching the glamorous Fay Wray, and the Empire State Building became a
global star.

The Empire State Building had been estimated to cost \$50 million. It
acually cost \$41 million (\$679 million in 2021). That's 17 percent
under budget, or \$141 million in 2021 dollars. Construction finished
several weeks before the opening ceremony.

I call the pattern followed by the Empire State Building and other
successful projects "Think slow, act fast."

At the start, I asked how a vision is turned into a plan that becomes a
triumphant new reality. As we will see, that is the answer: Think slow,
act fast.

## THINK SLOW, ACT FAST {.chapter-title}

*The record of big projects is even worse than it seems. But there is a
solution: Speed up by slowing down.*
:::

Denmark is a peninsula with islands scattered along its east coast.
Danes therefore long ago became experts at operating ferries and
building bridges. So it was no surprise, in the late 1980s, when the
government announced the Great Belt project. It comprised two bridges,
one of which would be the world's longest suspension bridge, to connect
two of the bigger islands, including the one with Copenhagen on it.
There would also be an underwater tunnel for trains---the second longest
in Europe---which would be built by a Danish-led contractor. That was
interesting because Danes had little experience boring tunnels. I
watched the announcement on the news with my father, who worked in
bridge and tunnel construction. "Bad idea," he grumbled. "If I were
digging a hole that big, I would hire someone who had done it before."

Things went wrong from the start. First there was a yearlong delay in
delivering four giant tunnel-boring machines. Then, as soon as the
machines were in the ground, they proved to be flawed and needed
redesign, delaying work another five months. Finally, the big machines
started slowly chewing their way under the ocean floor.

Up above, the bridge builders brought in a massive oceangoing dredger to
prepare their
worksite.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_19){#chapter001.xhtml_not_19}^ To do its
work, the dredger stabilized itself by lowering giant support legs into
the seafloor. When the []{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_4 .pagebreak
aria-label="4" role="doc-pagebreak"}work was done, the legs were lifted,
leaving deep holes. By accident, one of the holes happened to be on the
projected path of the tunnel. Neither the bridge builders nor the
tunnelers saw the danger.

One day, after a few weeks of boring, one of the four machines was
stopped for maintenance. It was about 250 meters (820 feet) out to sea
and an assumed 10 meters (33 feet) under the seafloor. Water was seeping
into the maintenance area in front of the machine, and a contractor
unfamiliar with tunneling hooked up a pump to get the water out. The
cables of the pump were trailed through a manhole into the boring
machine. Suddenly water started pouring in at a speed indicating a
breach of the tunnel. Evacuation was immediate---with no time to remove
the pump and cables and close the manhole.

The machine and the whole tunnel flooded. So did a parallel tunnel and
the boring machine within it.

Luckily, no one was injured or killed. But the salt water in the tunnel
was like acid to its metal and electronics. Engineers on the project
told me at the time that it would be cheaper to abandon the tunnel and
start again rather than pull out the borers, drain the tunnel, and
repair it. But politicians overrode them because an abandoned tunnel
would be too embarrassing. Inevitably, the whole project came in very
late and way over budget.

This story isn't all that unusual. There are lots more like it in the
annals of big projects. But it was that project that nudged me to start
a big project of my own---a database of big projects. It continues to
grow. In fact, it is now the world's largest of its kind.

And it has a great deal to teach us about what works, what doesn't, and
how to do better.

### [HONEST NUMBERS]{.sans} {.author-head1}

After the accident, the recovery, and the eventual completion of the
Great Belt bridges and tunnel, everyone agreed that the project had
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_5 .pagebreak aria-label="5"
role="doc-pagebreak"}gone badly over budget. But by how much? Management
said 29 percent for the whole project. I dug into the data, did my own
analysis, and discovered that their number was, shall we say,
optimistic. The actual overrun was 55 percent, and 120 percent for the
tunnel alone (in real terms, measured from the final investment
decision). Still, management kept repeating their number in public, and
I kept correcting them, until they did a public opinion poll that showed
that the public sided with me. Then they gave up. Later, an official
national audit confirmed my numbers, and the case was
closed.^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_20){#chapter001.xhtml_not_20}^

That experience taught me that megaproject management may not be a field
of what University of Washington public affairs professor Walter
Williams called "honest
numbers."^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_21){#chapter001.xhtml_not_21}^ As simple
as it should be in theory to judge projects, in practice it's anything
but. In every big project, there are blizzards of numbers generated at
different stages by different parties. Finding the right ones---those
that are valid and reliable---takes skill and work. Even trained
scholars get it
wrong.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_22){#chapter001.xhtml_not_22}^ And it
doesn't help that big projects involve money, reputations, and politics.
Those who have much to lose will spin the numbers, so you cannot trust
them. That's not fraud. Or rather, it's not usually fraud; it's human
nature. And with so many numbers to choose from, spinning is a lot
easier than finding the truth.

This is a serious problem. Projects are promised to be completed by a
certain time, at a certain cost, with certain benefits produced as a
result---benefits being things such as revenues, savings, passengers
moved, or megawatts of electricity generated. So how often do projects
deliver as promised? That is the most straightforward question anyone
could ask. But when I started to look around in the 1990s, I was stunned
to discover that no one could answer it. The data simply hadn't been
collected and analyzed. That made no sense when *trillions* of dollars
had been spent on the giant projects increasingly being called
megaprojects---projects with budgets in excess of \$1 billion.

Our database started with transportation projects: the Holland
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_6 .pagebreak aria-label="6"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Tunnel in New York; the BART system in San
Francisco; the Channel Tunnel in Europe; bridges, tunnels, highways, and
railways built throughout the twentieth century. It took five years, but
with my team I got 258 projects into the database, making it the biggest
of its kind at the
time.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_23){#chapter001.xhtml_not_23}^ When we
finally began publishing the numbers in 2002, it made waves because
nothing like it had been done
before.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_24){#chapter001.xhtml_not_24}^ Also, the
picture that emerged wasn't pretty.

"Project estimates between 1910 and 1998 were short of the final costs
an average of 28 percent," according to *The New York Times,*
summarizing our findings. "The biggest errors were in rail projects,
which ran, on average, 45 percent over estimated costs \[in
inflation-adjusted dollars\]. Bridges and tunnels were 34 percent over;
roads, 20 percent. Nine of 10 estimates were low, the study
said."^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_25){#chapter001.xhtml_not_25}^ The results
for time and benefits were similarly bad.

And these are conservative readings of the data. Measured
differently---from an earlier date and including inflation---the numbers
are *much* worse.^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_26){#chapter001.xhtml_not_26}^

The global consultancy McKinsey got in touch with me and proposed that
we do joint research. Its researchers had started investigating major
information technology projects---the biggest of which cost more than
\$10 billion---and their preliminary numbers were so dismal that they
said it would take a big improvement for IT projects to rise to the
level of awfulness of transportation projects. I laughed. It seemed
impossible that IT could be that bad. But I worked with McKinsey, and
indeed we found that IT disasters were even worse than transportation
disasters. But otherwise it was a broadly similar story of cost and
schedule overruns and benefit
shortfalls.^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_27){#chapter001.xhtml_not_27}^

That was startling. Think of a bridge or a tunnel. Now picture the US
government's HealthCare.gov website, which was a mess when it first
opened as the "Obamacare" enrollment portal. Or imagine the information
system used by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. These
IT projects are made of code, not steel and []{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_7
.pagebreak aria-label="7" role="doc-pagebreak"}concrete. They would seem
to be different from transportation infrastructure in every possible
way. So why would their outcomes be statistically so similar, with
consistent cost and schedule overruns and benefit shortfalls?

We shifted our research to mega-events such as the Olympic Games and got
the same result. Big dams? Same again. Rockets? Defense? Nuclear power?
The same. Oil and gas projects? Mining? Same. Even something as common
as building museums, concert halls, and skyscrapers fit the pattern. I
was astonished.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_28){#chapter001.xhtml_not_28}^

And the problem wasn't limited to any country or region; we found the
same pattern all over the
world.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_29){#chapter001.xhtml_not_29}^ The
famously efficient Germans have some remarkable examples of bloat and
waste, including Berlin's new Brandenburg Airport, which was years
delayed and billions of euros over budget, hovering on the verge of
bankruptcy only a year after opening in October
2020.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_30){#chapter001.xhtml_not_30}^

Even Switzerland, the nation of precise clocks and punctual trains, has
its share of embarrassing projects; for instance, the Lötschberg Base
Tunnel, which was completed late and with a cost overrun of 100 percent.

### [OVER BUDGET, OVER TIME, OVER AND OVER AGAIN]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The pattern was so clear that I started calling it the "Iron Law of
Megaprojects": over budget, over time, under benefits, over and over
again.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_31){#chapter001.xhtml_not_31}^

The Iron Law is not a "law" like in Newtonian physics, meaning something
that invariably produces the same outcome. I study people. In the social
sciences, "laws" are probabilistic (they are in natural science, too,
but Isaac Newton didn't pay much attention to that). And the probability
that any big project will blow its budget and schedule and deliver
disappointing benefits is very high and very reliable.

The database that started with 258 projects now contains more
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_8 .pagebreak aria-label="8"
role="doc-pagebreak"}than 16,000 projects from 20-plus different fields
in 136 countries on all continents except Antarctica, and it continues
to grow. There are some recent and important wrinkles in the numbers,
which I'll discuss later, but the general story remains the same: In
total, only 8.5 percent of projects hit the mark on both cost and time.
And a min-uscule 0.5 percent nail cost, time, and benefits. Or to put
that another way, 91.5 percent of projects go over budget, over
schedule, or both And 99.5 percent of projects go over budget, over
schedule, under benefits, or some combination of these. Doing what you
said you would do should be routine, or at least common. But it almost
never happens

Graphically, the Iron Law looks like this

![Start of image description, A vertical bar chart illustrates the Iron
Law of Project management - \'Over budget, over time, under benefits,
over and over again\'. 47.9 per cent of projects are completed on budget
or better. 8.5 per cent of projects are completed on budget and on time,
or better. Just 0.5 per cent of projects are completed on budget and on
time and on benefits., end of image description](images/img_001.jpg)

Tellingly, the 0.5 percent of projects that are on budget, time, and
benefits are nearly invisible to the naked eye. It's hard to overstate
how bad that record is. For anyone contemplating a big project, it is
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_9 .pagebreak aria-label="9"
role="doc-pagebreak"}truly depressing. But as grim as those numbers are,
they don't tell the full truth---which is *much* worse.

From experience, I know that most people are aware that cost and time
overruns are common. They don't know *how* common---they are usually
shocked when I show them my numbers---but they definitely know that if
they lead a big project, they should consider and protect themselves
against overruns, particularly cost overruns. The obvious way to do that
is to build a buffer into the budget. You hope it won't be needed, but
you'll be covered just in case. How big should that buffer be?
Typically, people make it 10 percent or 15 percent.

But let's say you are an unusually cautious person and you are planning
the construction of a large building. You put a 20 percent buffer into
the budget and think you are now well protected. But then you come
across my research and discover that the actual mean cost overrun of a
major building project is 62 percent. That is heart-stopping. It may
also be project-stopping. But let's say you are the very rare planner
who can get your financial backers to cover that risk and still go ahead
with the project. You now have an extraordinary 62 percent buffer built
into your budget. In the real world, that almost never happens. But
you're one of the fortunate few. Are you at last protected? No. In fact,
you have *still* drastically underestimated the danger.

That's because you have assumed that if you are hit with a cost overrun,
it will be somewhere around the mean---or 62 percent. Why did you assume
that? Because it would be true if the cost overruns followed what
statisticians call a "normal distribution." That's the famous bell
curve, which looks like a bell when graphed. Much of statistics is built
upon bell curves---sampling, averages, standard deviations, the law of
large numbers, regression to the mean, statistical tests---and it has
filtered into the culture and into the popular imagination, where it
fits well with how we intuitively grasp risk. In a normal distribution,
results are overwhelmingly lumped in the middle and there are very few
or no extreme observations at either end---the
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_10 .pagebreak aria-label="10"
role="doc-pagebreak"}so-called tails of the distribution. These tails
are therefore said to be *thin.*

Height is normally distributed. Depending on where you live, most adult
males are around five feet, nine inches (1.75 meters) tall, and the
tallest person in the world is only about 1.6 times taller than
that.^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_32){#chapter001.xhtml_not_32}^

But the "normal" distribution isn't the only sort of distribution that
exists---or even the most common one. So it is not normal in that sense
of the word. There are other distributions that are called "fat-tailed"
because, compared with normal distributions, they contain far more
extreme outcomes in their tails.

Wealth, for example, is fat-tailed. At the time of writing, the
wealthiest person in the world is 3,134,707 times wealthier than the
average person. If human height followed the same distribution as human
wealth, the tallest person in the world would not be 1.6 times taller
than the average person; he would be 3,311 miles (5,329 kilometers)
tall, meaning that his head would be thirteen times farther into outer
space than the International Space
Station.^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_33){#chapter001.xhtml_not_33}^

So the critical question is this: Are project outcomes distributed
"normally," or do they have fat tails? My database revealed that
information technology projects have fat tails. To illustrate, 18
percent of IT projects have cost overruns above 50 percent in real
terms. And for those projects the average overrun is 447 percent! That's
the *average* in the tail, meaning that many IT projects in the tail
have even higher overruns than this. Information technology is *truly*
fat-tailed!^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_34){#chapter001.xhtml_not_34}^ So are
nuclear storage projects. And the Olympic Games. And nuclear power
plants. And big hydroelectric dams. As are airports, defense projects,
big buildings, aerospace projects, tunnels, mining projects, high-speed
rail, urban rail, conventional rail, bridges, oil projects, gas
projects, and water projects. (See [Appendix A](#app.xhtml).)

In fact, most project types have fat tails. How "fat" their tails
are---how many projects fall into the extremes and how extreme those
extremes are---does vary. I've cited them in order, from fattest to
least []{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_11 .pagebreak aria-label="11"
role="doc-pagebreak"}fat (but still fat)---or, if you prefer, from most
at risk of terrifying overruns to less at risk (but still very much at
risk).^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_35){#chapter001.xhtml_not_35}^

There *are* a few project types that do not have fat tails. That's
important. I'll explain why, and how we can all make use of this fact,
in the last chapter.

But for now the lesson is simple, clear, and scary: Most big projects
are not merely at risk of not delivering as promised. Nor are they only
at risk of going seriously wrong. They are at risk of going
*disastrously* wrong because their risk is fat-tailed. Against that
background, it is interesting to note that the project management
literature almost completely ignores systematic study of the
fat-tailedness of project risk.

What do fat-tailed outcomes look like? Boston's "Big Dig"---replacing an
elevated highway with a tunnel, with construction started in 1991---put
the city through the wringer for sixteen years and cost more than
*triple* what it was supposed to. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope,
which is now almost a million miles from Earth, was forecast to take
twelve years but required nineteen to complete, while its final cost of
\$8.8 billion was an astronomical---forgive me---450 percent over
budget. Canada's firearms registry, an IT project, went 590 percent over
budget. And then there is Scotland's Parliament Building. When it opened
in 2004, it was three years late and a bagpipe-exploding 978 percent
over budget.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb famously dubbed low-probability, high-consequence
events "black swans." Disastrous project outcomes such as these can end
careers, sink companies, and inflict a variety of other carnage. They
definitely qualify as black swans.

Just look at what a black swan outcome did to Kmart: Responding to
competitive pressure from Walmart and Target, it launched two enormous
IT projects in 2000. Costs exploded, contributing directly to the
company's decision to file for bankruptcy in
2002.^[18](#notes.xhtml#note_36){#chapter001.xhtml_not_36}^ Or consider
what another IT blowout did to the legendary jeans maker Levi
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_12 .pagebreak aria-label="12"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Strauss: Originally forecast to cost \$5 million,
the project forced the company to take a \$200 million loss and show its
CIO the door.^[19](#notes.xhtml#note_37){#chapter001.xhtml_not_37}^

There are worse fates for executives. When a troubled nuclear power
plant project in South Carolina fell badly behind schedule, the CEO of
the company in charge withheld that information from regulators "in an
effort to keep the project going," noted a 2021 US Department of Justice
press release, which also announced that the executive had been
sentenced to two years in federal prison and forced to pay \$5.2 million
in forfeitures and
fines.^[20](#notes.xhtml#note_38){#chapter001.xhtml_not_38}^ Black swan
outcomes do indeed have consequences for projects and those who lead
them.

If you are not a corporate executive or government official, and if the
ambitious project you are contemplating is on a much smaller scale than
these giants, it may be tempting to think that none of this applies to
you. Resist that temptation. My data show that smaller projects are
susceptible to fat tails, too. Moreover, fat-tailed distributions, not
normal distributions, are typical within complex systems, both natural
and human, and we all live and work within increasingly complex systems,
which means increasingly interdependent systems. Cities and towns are
complex systems. Markets are complex systems. Energy production and
distribution are complex systems. Manufacturing and transportation are
complex systems. Debt is a complex system. So are viruses. And climate
change. And globalization. On and on the list goes. If your project is
ambitious and depends on other people and many parts, it is all but
certain that your project is embedded in complex systems.

That describes projects of all types and scales, all the way down to
home renovations. A few years ago, in a BBC show about renovating
historic British properties, one episode featured a London couple who
bought a run-down house in the countryside and got a builder to estimate
the cost of a complete renovation. He pegged it at \$260,000. Eighteen
months later, the project was far from done and the couple had already
spent \$1.3
million.^[21](#notes.xhtml#note_39){#chapter001.xhtml_not_39}^ That is
the sort of overrun []{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_13 .pagebreak
aria-label="13" role="doc-pagebreak"}we would expect to find in a
fat-tailed distribution. And it is certainly not unique. Later in the
book, we'll witness a home renovation in Brooklyn spin wildly out of
control and inflict an equally devastating overrun on the unfortunate
and unexpecting homeowners.

That London couple were apparently wealthy enough to keep funding the
renovation. Similarly, major corporations on the hook for runaway
projects may be able to keep things going by borrowing more and more
money. Governments can also pile up debt. Or raise taxes. But most
ordinary folks and small businesses cannot draw on a big stockpile of
wealth, run up debt, or raise taxes. If they start a project that
hurtles toward the fat tail of the distribution, they will simply be
wiped out, giving them even more reason than a corporate executive or
government official to take the danger seriously.

And that starts by understanding what causes project failure.

### [THE WINDOW OF DOOM]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The patterns I mentioned earlier, confirmed by my data, are strong
clues: Projects that fail tend to drag on, while those that succeed zip
along and finish.

Why is that? Think of the duration of a project as an open window. The
longer the duration, the more open the window. The more open the window,
the more opportunity for something to crash through and cause trouble,
including a big, bad black swan.

What could that black swan be? Almost anything. It could be something
dramatic, like an election upset, a stock market collapse, or a
pandemic. After Covid-19 emerged in January 2020, projects all over the
world---from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics to the release of the James Bond
movie *No Time to Die*---were delayed, postponed, or scrapped
altogether. Events such as these may be extremely unlikely on any given
day, month, or year. But the more time that passes from the decision to
do a project to its delivery, the greater their probability.

[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_14 .pagebreak aria-label="14"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Notice that these big, dramatic events, which are
easily capable of damaging a project so badly that it delivers a black
swan outcome, are themselves low probability and high consequence. That
is, they are black swans. So a black swan crashing through the window of
vulnerability may itself cause a black swan outcome.

But drama isn't necessary for change to batter and bury projects. Even
mundane change can do that. Journalists who write biographies of
up-and-coming politicians know, for example, that the market for their
books depends on the politician continuing to be on the rise when the
book is released. Any number of events can change that: a scandal, a
lost election; an illness; a death. Even something as simple as the
politician getting bored with politics and taking another job would ruin
the project. Again, the more time that passes from decision to delivery,
the greater the probability of one or more of these events happening.
It's even possible that trivial events, in just the wrong circumstances,
can have devastating consequences.

It's hard to think of anything more trivial to most people around the
world than gusts of wind in the Egyptian desert. Yet on March 23, 2021,
it was just such gusts, at just the wrong moment, that pushed the bow of
*Ever Given,* a giant container ship, into a bank of the Suez Canal. The
ship got stuck and couldn't be budged for six days, blocking the canal,
halting hundreds of ships, freezing an estimated \$10 billion in trade
each day, and sending shocks rippling through global supply
chains.^[22](#notes.xhtml#note_40){#chapter001.xhtml_not_40}^ The people
and projects who suffered as a result of those supply-chain troubles may
never have realized it, but the cause of their trouble was ultimately
strong winds in a faraway
desert.^[23](#notes.xhtml#note_41){#chapter001.xhtml_not_41}^

A complex systems theorist might describe what happened by saying that
the dynamic interdependencies among the parts of the system---the wind,
the canal, the ship, and supply chains---created strong nonlinear
responses and amplification. In plain English, minor changes combined in
a way to produce a disaster. In complex systems,
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_15 .pagebreak aria-label="15"
role="doc-pagebreak"}that happens so often that the Yale sociologist
Charles Perrow called such events "normal
accidents."^[24](#notes.xhtml#note_42){#chapter001.xhtml_not_42}^

Growing complexity and interdependency may make such outcomes more
likely in today's world, but they are hardly a new phenomenon. A proverb
that originated in the Middle Ages and comes in many forms tells us,
"For want of a nail, the shoe was lost. For want of a shoe, the horse
was lost. For want of a horse, the rider was lost. For want of a rider,
the battle was lost. For want of a battle, the kingdom was lost." This
version was published by Benjamin Franklin in 1758, and he introduced it
with the warning that "a little neglect may breed great mischief." The
key word is *may*. Most nails can be lost without anything bad happening
at all. A few such losses will have consequences, but they will be
minor, like the loss of one horse or one rider. But sometimes a lost
nail may cause something truly terrible.

From the dramatic to the mundane to the trivial, change can rattle or
ruin a project---if it occurs during the window of time when the project
is ongoing.

Solution? Close the window.

Of course, a project can't be completed instantly, so we can't close the
window entirely. But we can make the opening radically smaller by
speeding up the project and bringing it to a conclusion faster. That is
a main means of reducing risk on any project.

In sum, keep it short!

### [THE NEED FOR SPEED]{.sans} {.author-head1}

How do we get a project done as quickly as possible? The obvious
answer---and certainly the most common one---is to set severe timelines,
get started right away, and demand that everyone involved work at a
furious pace. Drive and ambition are key, goes the conventional wisdom.
If experienced observers think a project will take two years,
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_16 .pagebreak aria-label="16"
role="doc-pagebreak"}say you will do it in one. Commit to the project,
heart and soul, and charge ahead. And in managing others, be fierce.
Demand that everything be done yesterday. Like the drummer on a Roman
galley preparing to ram a ship, beat the drum at a furious pace.

This thinking is as misguided as it is common. There is a monument to it
in Copenhagen.

The Copenhagen Opera House, the home of the Royal Danish Opera, was the
vision of Arnold Maersk Mc-Kinney Møller, the CEO and chairman of
Maersk, the Danish shipping giant. In the late 1990s, Møller, who was
then in his late eighties, decided he wanted a grand building situated
prominently at the harborside as his very visible and permanent legacy.
And he wanted it designed and built quickly. The queen of Denmark would
attend the opening, and Møller had no intention of missing his big
night. When Møller asked the architect, Henning Larsen, how long it
would take, Larsen said five years. "You'll get four!" Møller curtly
responded.^[25](#notes.xhtml#note_43){#chapter001.xhtml_not_43}^ With
much beating of galley drums, the deadline was met, and Møller and the
queen opened the opera house together on January 15, 2005.

But the cost of that haste was terrible, and not only in terms of cost
overruns. Larsen was so appalled by the completed building that he wrote
a whole book to clear his reputation and explain the confused structure,
which he called a "mausoleum."

Haste makes waste.

Even that cost is mild compared to what rushing projects this way can
do. In 2021, after an overpass collapsed beneath a metro train in Mexico
City, three independent investigations concluded that rushed, shoddy
work was to blame. A Norwegian firm hired by the city to conduct an
investigation concluded that the tragedy had been caused by
"deficiencies in the construction process," as did a later report
released by the attorney general of Mexico
City.^[26](#notes.xhtml#note_44){#chapter001.xhtml_not_44}^ *The New
York Times* did its own investigation and concluded that the city's
insistence that construction be completed before the city's powerful
mayor was due []{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_17 .pagebreak aria-label="17"
role="doc-pagebreak"}to leave office had been a key contributing cause
of the collapse. "The scramble led to a frenzied construction process
that began before a master plan had been finalized and produced a metro
line with defects from the start," the *Times*
concluded.^[27](#notes.xhtml#note_45){#chapter001.xhtml_not_45}^ The
collapse of the overpass killed twenty-six people. Haste makes not only
waste but tragedy.

### [MAKE HASTE---SLOWLY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

To understand the right way to get a project done quickly, it's useful
to think of a project as being divided into two phases. This is a
simplification, but it works: first, planning; second, delivery. The
terminology varies by industry---in movies, it's "development and
production"; in architecture, "design and construction"---but the basic
idea is the same everywhere: Think first, then do.

A project begins with a vision that is, at best, a vague image of the
glorious thing the project will become. Planning is pushing the vision
to the point where it is sufficiently researched, analyzed, tested, and
detailed that we can be confident we have a reliable road map of the way
forward.

Most planning is done with computers, paper, and physical models,
meaning that planning is relatively cheap and safe. Barring other time
pressures, it's fine for planning to be slow. Delivery is another
matter. Delivery is when serious money is spent and the project becomes
vulnerable as a consequence.

Consider a Hollywood director working on a live-action movie project in
February 2020. The Covid pandemic is about to arrive. How badly will
that hurt the project? The answer depends on what stage the project is
in. If the director and her team are writing scripts, drawing
storyboards, and scheduling location shoots---if they are planning, in
other words---it's a problem but not a disaster. In fact, a lot of the
work will probably continue despite the pandemic. But what if, when the
pandemic arrives, the director is filming in the
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_18 .pagebreak aria-label="18"
role="doc-pagebreak"}streets of New York with a crew of two hundred plus
a handful of very expensive movie stars? Or what if the movie is
finished but still a month away from its release in theaters that are
about to close indefinitely? That's not a problem; it's a disaster.

Planning is a safe harbor. Delivery is venturing across the storm-tossed
seas. This is a major reason why, at Pixar---the legendary studio that
created *Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Soul,* and so many
other era-defining animated movies---"directors are allowed to spend
years in the development phase of a movie," noted Ed Catmull, a
co-founder of Pixar. There is a cost associated with exploring ideas,
writing scripts, storyboarding images, and doing it all over and over
again. But "the costs of iterations are relatively
low."^[28](#notes.xhtml#note_46){#chapter001.xhtml_not_46}^ And all that
good work produces a rich, detailed, tested, and proven plan. When the
project moves into the production phase, it will, as a consequence of
all that work, be relatively smooth and quick. That's essential, Catmull
noted, because production "is where costs explode."

Not only is it safer for planning to be slow, it is *good* for planning
to be slow, as the directors at Pixar well know. After all, cultivating
ideas and innovations takes time. Spotting the implications of different
options and approaches takes more time. Puzzling through complex
problems, coming up with solutions, and putting them to the test take
still more time. Planning requires thinking---and creative, critical,
careful thinking is slow.

Abraham Lincoln is reputed to have said that if he had five minutes to
chop down a tree, he'd spend the first three sharpening the
ax.^[29](#notes.xhtml#note_47){#chapter001.xhtml_not_47}^ That's exactly
the right approach for big projects: Put enormous care and effort into
planning to ensure that delivery is smooth and swift.

*Think slow, act fast:* That's the secret of success.

"Think slow, act fast" may not be a new idea. It was on grand display
back in 1931, after all, when the Empire State Building raced to the
sky. You could even say that the idea goes at least as far back as
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_19 .pagebreak aria-label="19"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Rome's first emperor, the mighty Caesar Augustus,
whose personal motto was "*Festina lente,*" or "Make haste slowly."

But "Think slow, act fast" is not how big projects are typically done.
"Think fast, act slow" is. The track record of big projects
unequivocally shows that.

### [PROJECTS DON'T *GO* WRONG, THEY *START* WRONG]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Look at California High-Speed Rail. When it was approved by voters and
construction started, there were lots of documents and numbers that may
have superficially resembled a plan. But there was no carefully
detailed, deeply researched, and thoroughly tested program, which is to
say that there was no real plan. Louis Thompson, an expert on
transportation projects who chairs the California High-Speed Rail Peer
Review Group convened by the California State Legislature, says that
what California had in hand when the project got under way could at best
be described as a "vision" or an
"aspiration."^[30](#notes.xhtml#note_48){#chapter001.xhtml_not_48}^ It's
no wonder that problems started multiplying and progress slowed to a
crawl soon after delivery began.

That is, sadly, typical. On project after project, rushed, superficial
planning is followed by a quick start that makes everybody happy because
shovels are in the ground. But inevitably, the project crashes into
problems that were overlooked or not seriously analyzed and dealt with
in planning. People run around trying to fix things. More stuff breaks.
There is more running around. I call this the "break-fix cycle." A
project that enters it is like a mammoth stuck in a tar pit.

People say that projects "go wrong," which they all too often do. But
phrasing it that way is misleading; projects don't *go* wrong so much as
they *start* wrong.

This raises an urgent question: If "Think slow, act fast" is the wise
approach, why do leaders of big projects so often do the opposite? I'll
answer that question in chapter 2.

[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_20 .pagebreak aria-label="20"
role="doc-pagebreak"}In chapter 3, I'll look at how to start a project
without stumbling into the "Think fast, act slow" tar pit.

People often think that planning is about filling in flowcharts. And too
often, it is. But it shouldn't be. In chapter 4, I'll take a close look
at what I call "Pixar planning," how the movie studio and others use
simulation and iteration to produce a plan that is creative, rigorous,
detailed, and reliable---and highly likely to make delivery smooth and
swift. I'll use "Pixar planning" as a name and a model for planning, not
just at Pixar but for any planning that develops a tested and tried
plan; that is, a plan worthy of its name.

In chapter 5, I'll examine the invaluable role of experience in both
planning and delivery of big projects---or rather, the invaluable role
it could play if it were not so often marginalized, misunderstood, or
simply ignored.

In chapter 6, it's on to forecasting. How long will the project take?
How much will it cost? Setting the wrong expectations at the start can
set you up for failure before you've even started. Fortunately, there is
a fix. More fortunately, it's surprisingly easy.

Some people will object to all this emphasis on planning. They believe
that big projects, particularly creative projects such as movies,
signature architecture, or innovative software, get better results when
people take a leap of faith, get started right away, and rely on
ingenuity to see them through. In chapter 7, I'll examine this argument
in its strongest form---and present the data to prove that it's dead
wrong.

But even the best plan won't succeed if it doesn't have a solid team
delivering it. So in chapter 8, I'll look at how one giant project
successfully drew together thousands of people from hundreds of
different organizations with different interests and turned them into a
united, determined, effective team that delivered the planned benefits
on time and on budget.

In the final chapter, I'll draw on the themes of the previous chapters
to explore a concept that brings them all together: modularity. Its
[]{#chapter001.xhtml_Page_21 .pagebreak aria-label="21"
role="doc-pagebreak"}potential is huge. Not only can it cut costs, boost
quality, and speed things up for a vast array of projects from wedding
cakes to subways, it can transform how we build infrastructure---and
even help save the world from climate change.

But first we have to answer that question about why projects so often
start prematurely. Let me tell you the story of a man in a hurry---and
how he almost ruined one of the most beautiful places in the United
States.

## THE COMMITMENT FALLACY {.chapter-title}

::: ext2
*If "Think slow, act fast" is the wise approach to big projects, why do
so many people do the exact opposite? Because they rush to commit. You
do need to commit. But not in the way you think.*
:::

In July 1941, the United States was the last major power sitting out
World War II. Few expected that to last. President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt had declared a national emergency and was rapidly expanding
the country's tiny peacetime military into a giant capable of fighting
fascism in Europe and the Pacific.

The government's War Department, scattered around Washington, DC, in a
number of small office buildings, urgently needed a proper headquarters.
It would have to be huge. And it would have to be built quickly. That
was the conclusion of Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell, the chief
of the army's Construction Division. And when Brehon Somervell decided
to do something, it usually got done. He was an engineer with a record
of building big things---most recently New York's LaGuardia
Airport---faster than anyone had thought possible. "He drove his staff
relentlessly, seven days a week, leaving officers exhausted," wrote
Steve Vogel, the author of *The Pentagon: A History,* a superb chronicle
of the building's
construction.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_49){#chapter002.xhtml_not_49}^

### []{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_23 .pagebreak aria-label="23" role="doc-pagebreak"}[THE MISSHAPEN PENTAGON]{.sans} {.author-head1}

On the evening of July 17, a Thursday, Somervell gave his staff their
marching orders: Draft a plan for an office building of five hundred
thousand square feet, twice as much as in the Empire State Building. But
it can't be a skyscraper; that would take too much steel at a time when
steel is needed for ships and tanks. And it can't be in the District of
Columbia; there is no room. It has to be across the Potomac River in
Virginia, on the site of a recently abandoned airfield. Half the
building will be finished and operating in six months, Somervell told
them. The whole thing will be fully open in a year. Have the plan on my
desk Monday morning, the general said, ending his instructions.

Somervell's staff quickly realized that the selected site was a marshy
floodplain unsuitable for construction. They scrambled to find another
site and came up with one half a mile upriver on a plateau between
Arlington National Cemetery and the Potomac. The new site was called
"Arlington Farm." Somervell approved the switch.

Arlington Farm was bounded on five sides by roads, giving it an
irregular shape. To make the building as big as it needed to be,
Somervell's staff designed it to fill most of the land within the five
sides. The result was a misshapen pentagon. It was downright ugly, a
draftsman recalled later, but "it
fit."^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_50){#chapter002.xhtml_not_50}^

On Monday morning, the plan was on Somervell's desk. He approved it,
took it to the secretary of war, praised it, and got the secretary's
sign-off. Then he took the plan to a congressional subcommittee, praised
it some more, and got the subcommittee's unanimous support. The
secretary of war then took the plan to the cabinet, where President
Roosevelt nodded his personal approval. The entire process took exactly
one week.

Reading this so many decades later, you may think you know how the story
ends. The Pentagon was indeed built, it played a critical role
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_24 .pagebreak aria-label="24"
role="doc-pagebreak"}during the Second World War, and it became one of
the most famous buildings in the world. So maybe this is a model of how
to quickly plan and deliver a big project? But no. Notice that the
pentagon described here is "misshapen." The Pentagon that we know today
is not. It is symmetrical. And it is *not* the product of Somervell's
original plan, which was never used. Because the plan was terrible.

To see why, you need to follow the millions of tourists who annually
cross the Potomac River to stand at the heart of Arlington National
Cemetery. You're on a high bluff. In the distance, you can see the
Capitol dome, the Washington Monument, and all the other grand buildings
and monuments of Washington, DC. The gentle slopes of the bluff are
green and covered with long, straight lines of headstones marking the
last resting places of Americans who died in combat or served their
country in uniform as far back as the Civil War. Prominent among them is
the grave of John F. Kennedy.

And right there, smack in the middle of that beautiful and bittersweet
vista, is the site once known as Arlington Farm, the place where Brehon
Somervell wanted to build the world's biggest and ugliest office
building. Imagine building a ring of banal skyscrapers around the Eiffel
Tower. That's how bad Somervell's plan was. "The unparalleled view of
Washington from the heights of Arlington Cemetery would be distorted by
acres upon acres of ugly flat roofs," a newspaper editorialist moaned in
1941 after Somervell's plan was made public. It "would be an act of
vandalism."^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_51){#chapter002.xhtml_not_51}^

In Somervell's defense, the United States was facing a global emergency,
so you might think that aesthetic and cultural concerns had to be thrown
overboard. His staff had no choice.

Except they did. Less than a mile south of the Arlington Farm site and
just outside Arlington Cemetery's spectacular vista lay the
"Quartermaster Depot" site. It met all the technical requirements.
Somervell's critics identified the site and fought to move the project
there. Eventually, they won. That's where the Pentagon is today. Not
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_25 .pagebreak aria-label="25"
role="doc-pagebreak"}only did that site leave the view from Arlington
Cemetery unsullied; the size of the site allowed the architects to even
up the sides of the building and make it symmetrical. That made the
building more functional, cheaper to build, and a lot less ugly.

So why didn't Somervell realize that there was a much better site
available before he sought and got approval for the original design? Why
didn't any of those who approved the plan spot the flaw? Because
Somervell's plan was so absurdly rushed and superficial that no one had
even looked for other sites, much less considered their relative merits
carefully. They had all treated the first suitable site identified as
the *only* suitable site and hurried to get construction going as
quickly as possible. Such limited vision is rooted deep in our
psychology, as we will see later. That doesn't make it any the wiser for
big projects.

Harold Ickes, Roosevelt's long-serving secretary of the interior, was
appalled when the president gave quick approval to Somervell's original
plan. "Here was another example of acting before thinking," he wrote in
his diary---words that can be applied with depressing frequency to big
projects.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_52){#chapter002.xhtml_not_52}^

### [THE RUSH TO COMMIT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Brehon Somervell was anything but a foolish or incompetent person. The
same was true of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the other highly
accomplished people who approved Somervell's plan. Yet in this case,
they proceeded in a way that is self-evidently foolish and incompetent.
It seems hard to fathom. But fathom it we must, because although the
details of this story may be extreme---particularly the speed---it is
fundamentally typical of how big projects come together. Purposes and
goals are *not* carefully considered. Alternatives are *not* explored.
Difficulties and risks are *not* investigated. Solutions are *not*
found. Instead, shallow analysis is followed by quick lock-in to a
decision that sweeps aside all the other forms the project could take.
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_26 .pagebreak aria-label="26"
role="doc-pagebreak"}"Lock-in," as scholars refer to it, is the notion
that although there may be alternatives, most people and organizations
behave as if they have no choice but to push on, even past the point
where they put themselves at more cost or risk than they would have
accepted at the start. This is followed by action. And usually, sometime
after that, by trouble; for instance, in the guise of the "break-fix
cycle" mentioned in chapter 1.

I call such premature lock-in the "commitment fallacy." It is a
behavioral bias on a par with the other biases identified by behavioral
science.

The only thing that is truly unusual about the Pentagon story is that a
group of politically connected critics managed to expose the flaws in
Somervell's plan after it had been approved and get the project moved to
another site---the one where the Pentagon is today. Happy endings are
rare when projects start in a rush based on the commitment fallacy.

It is not exactly a secret that careful thinking about what a project is
trying to achieve and how best to bring it about is more likely to lead
to a positive outcome than a rushed commitment is. "Act in haste, repent
at leisure" is a centuries-old chestnut. One variation of that saying
replaces "act" with "marry." And in the novel *Infinite Jest,* David
Foster Wallace observed that this old advice seems "custom-designed for
the case of tattoos." Tattoos, marriages, big projects: In every case,
we know we really should think it through carefully, so why do we so
often fail to do so?

I can't help with tattoos and marriages, but when it comes to big
projects, there are several explanations.

One is what I call "strategic misrepresentation," the tendency to
deliberately and systematically distort or misstate information for
strategic purposes.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_53){#chapter002.xhtml_not_53}^
If you want to win a contract or get a project approved, superficial
planning is handy because it glosses over major challenges, which keeps
the estimated cost and time down, which []{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_27
.pagebreak aria-label="27" role="doc-pagebreak"}wins contracts and gets
projects approved. But as certain as the law of gravity, challenges
ignored during planning will eventually boomerang back as delays and
cost overruns during delivery. By then the project will be too far along
to turn back. Getting to that point of no return is the real goal of
strategic misrepresentation. It is politics, resulting in failure by
design.

A second is psychology. In 2003, I had a spirited debate with Daniel
Kahneman, a Nobel laureate and arguably the most influential living
psychologist, in the pages of the *Harvard Business Review* after he
co-wrote an article pinning responsibility for bad decisions on
psychology. I agreed, of course, that psychology was at work. The
question was how much it was to blame relative to
politics.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_54){#chapter002.xhtml_not_54}^

After debating in print, Kahneman invited me to meet and discuss matters
further. I also arranged for him to visit megaproject planners so he
could study their experiences firsthand. Eventually each of us came to
accept the other's position: psychology for me and politics for
Kahneman.^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_55){#chapter002.xhtml_not_55}^ Which
factor is most important depends on the character of decisions and
projects. In Kahneman's laboratory experiments, the stakes are low.
There is typically no jockeying for position, no competition for scarce
resources, no powerful individuals or organizations, no politics of any
kind. The closer a project is to that situation, the more individual
psychology will dominate, which is what Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and
other behavioral scientists have found. But as projects get bigger and
decisions more consequential, the influence of money and power grows.
Powerful individuals and organizations make the decisions, the number of
stakeholders increases, they lobby for their specific interests, and the
name of the game is *politics.* And the balance shifts from psychology
to strategic
misrepresentation.^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_56){#chapter002.xhtml_not_56}^

That said, the common denominator of any project is that people are
making the decisions about it. And wherever there are people, there are
psychology and power.

Let's start with psychology.

### []{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_28 .pagebreak aria-label="28" role="doc-pagebreak"}[YOU WANT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, NOT THE PILOT, TO BE AN OPTIMIST]{.sans} {.author-head1}

We are a deeply optimistic species. That makes us an overconfident
species.^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_57){#chapter002.xhtml_not_57}^ The large
majority of car drivers say that their driving skills are above
average.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_58){#chapter002.xhtml_not_58}^ Most
small-business owners are confident that their new business will succeed
even though most small businesses
fail.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_59){#chapter002.xhtml_not_59}^ Smokers
believe that they are at less risk of lung cancer than other
smokers.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_60){#chapter002.xhtml_not_60}^ There are
countless more illustrations like these in the psychological literature.

The sheer pervasiveness of optimism and overconfidence suggests that
they are useful for us, individually and collectively, and there's
plenty of research and experience to support that conclusion. We
definitely need optimism and a can-do attitude to inspire big projects
and see them through. Or to get married and have kids. Or to get up in
the morning. But if while boarding a plane you overhear the pilot say,
"I'm optimistic about the fuel situation," get off immediately, because
this is neither the time nor the place for optimism. My key heuristic
for managing optimism on projects is "You want the flight attendant, not
the pilot, to be an optimist." What you need from your pilot, and must
insist on, is hard-nosed analysis that sees reality as clearly as
possible. The same holds for optimism about budgets and schedules on big
projects, which are their "fuel readings." Unchecked, optimism leads to
unrealistic forecasts, poorly defined goals, better options ignored,
problems not spotted and dealt with, and no contingencies to counteract
the inevitable surprises. Yet, as we will see in later chapters,
optimism routinely displaces hard-nosed analysis in big projects, as in
so much else people do.

"Optimism is widespread, stubborn, and costly," observed Kahneman. His
work with Tversky helped explain
why.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_61){#chapter002.xhtml_not_61}^

One of the basic insights of modern psychology is that quick and
intuitive "snap judgments" are the default operating system of human
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_29 .pagebreak aria-label="29"
role="doc-pagebreak"}decision making---"System One," to use the term
coined by the psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West and made
famous by Kahneman. Conscious reasoning is a different system: System
Two.^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_62){#chapter002.xhtml_not_62}^ A key
difference between Systems One and Two is speed. System One is fast, so
it always delivers first. System Two is slow; it can get involved only
after System One delivers. Both systems may be right or wrong.

To generate snap judgments, the brain can't be overly demanding about
information. Instead, it proceeds on the basis of what Kahneman calls
"WYSIATI" (What You See Is All There Is), meaning an assumption that
whatever information we have on hand is all the information available to
make the decision.

After a quick and intuitive judgment is delivered by System One, we can
think about the problem slowly and carefully, if we have time, using
System Two, the conscious mind, and adjust the snap judgment or entirely
override it. But another basic insight of psychology is that when we
have a strong intuitive judgment we seldom subject it to slow, careful,
critical scrutiny. We just go with it, spontaneously settling for
whatever System One decided.

It's important to distinguish intuitive judgments from emotions such as
anger, fear, love, or sadness. They, too, may inspire rash conclusions.
We all know---at least when we're thinking coolly---that strong emotions
are not necessarily logical or supported by evidence and are therefore
an unreliable basis for judgment. Any reasonable boss who experiences a
surge of anger toward an employee knows she should wait a day and calm
down before deciding whether to fire him or her. But the intuitive
judgments generated by System One are not experienced as emotions. They
simply "feel" true. With the truth in hand, it seems perfectly
reasonable to act on it. As Kahneman wrote, System One is "a machine for
jumping to conclusions."

This is what makes optimism bias so potent. Small-business owners who
are sure they will avoid the fate of most small-business
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_30 .pagebreak aria-label="30"
role="doc-pagebreak"}owners---bankruptcy---would be offended if you told
them that their belief comes less from a rational assessment of the
evidence and more from a psychological bias. That doesn't *feel* true.
What feels true is that their business will succeed.

Although much of Kahneman and Tversky's work focuses on how decision
making dominated by System One can fail, it's important to recognize
that quick, intuitive judgment often works remarkably well. That's *why*
it is our default, as argued by the German psychologist Gerd
Gigerenzer.^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_63){#chapter002.xhtml_not_63}^
Decades ago, when Gary Klein, yet another psychologist, started studying
how people make decisions at work and at home, he quickly realized that
the classical decision theory he had been taught in university---that
people identify the available set of options, carefully weigh them, and
choose the best---wasn't remotely how they operate in real life. We
typically don't engage in such careful calculation even when we are
deciding whether to take a job offer or make some other highly
consequential
decision.^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_64){#chapter002.xhtml_not_64}^ Instead,
as Klein demonstrated, people ordinarily take the first option that
occurs to them and quickly run it through a mental simulation. If it
seems to work, they go with that option. If it doesn't, they search for
another and repeat the process. This method tends to work well for
familiar decisions, especially when there is little time to make them,
and it can work brilliantly when done by an expert, as we will see
later. But in the wrong circumstances, it's a mistake.

Look at how Brehon Somervell decided where to put the Pentagon. The
first site he thought of was the abandoned airfield. At a glance, it
seemed to work, so he told his staff to plan the building for that site.
His staff discovered that the site was unsuitable and identified
another, Arlington Farm, that seemed to work. So Somervell went with
that, again without asking if there might be other, better sites. He was
applying the standard decision process under the wrong circumstances. It
was far from a familiar problem, and he could
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_31 .pagebreak aria-label="31"
role="doc-pagebreak"}certainly have afforded the few days it would have
taken to look around and compare sites. Although he had loads of other
experience, he had never planned and built a massive office building and
never worked in the District of Columbia or Virginia. To an extent, at
least in the planning stages of the project, he was a rookie.

This is typical of the planning of big projects. It's just not suitable
for the sort of quick-and-intuitive decision making that comes naturally
to us. But all too often we apply it anyway---because it comes naturally
to us. If we are routinely biased toward snap judgments and unrealistic
optimism and these methods fail to deliver, we will suffer. Shouldn't we
learn from those painful experiences? We should indeed. But to do that,
we must pay attention to experience. And unfortunately, too often we do
not.

### [HOFSTADTER'S LAW]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Forty years ago, Kahneman and Tversky showed that people commonly
underestimate the time required to complete tasks even when there is
information available that suggests the estimate is unreasonable. They
called this the "planning fallacy," a term that with Harvard law
professor Cass Sunstein I have also applied to underestimates of cost
and overestimates of
benefits.^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_65){#chapter002.xhtml_not_65}^ The
physicist and writer Douglas Hofstadter mockingly dubbed it
"Hofstadter's Law": "It always takes longer than you expect, even when
you take into account Hofstadter's
Law."^[18](#notes.xhtml#note_66){#chapter002.xhtml_not_66}^

Research documents that the planning fallacy is pervasive, but we need
only look at ourselves and the people around us to know that. You expect
to get downtown on a Saturday night within twenty minutes, but it takes
forty minutes instead and now you're late---just like last time and the
time before that. You think you'll have your toddler asleep after
fifteen minutes of bedtime stories, but it takes half an
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_32 .pagebreak aria-label="32"
role="doc-pagebreak"}hour---as usual. You're sure you will submit your
term paper a few days early this time, but you end up pulling an
all-nighter and make the deadline with a minute to spare---as always.

These aren't intentional miscalculations. Much of the voluminous
research on the subject involves people who are not trying to win a
contract, get financing for a project, or build a monument to
themselves, so they have no reason to lowball their estimates. But still
the estimates are much too rosy. In one study, researchers asked
students to estimate how long it would take them to finish various
academic and personal tasks and then asked them to break down their
estimates by confidence level---meaning that someone might say she was
50 percent confident of finishing in a week, 60 percent confident of
being done in two weeks, and so on, all the way up to 99 percent
confidence. Incredibly, when people said there was a 99 percent
probability that they would be done---that it was virtually
certain---only 45 percent actually finished by that
time.^[19](#notes.xhtml#note_67){#chapter002.xhtml_not_67}^

For us to be so consistently wrong, we must consistently ignore
experience. And we do, for various reasons. When we think of the future,
the past may simply not come to mind and we may not think to dig it up
because it's the present and future we are interested in. If it does
surface, we may think "This time is different" and dismiss it (an option
that's always available because, in a sense, every moment in life is
unique). Or we may just be a little lazy and prefer not to bother, a
preference well documented in Kahneman's work. We all do this. Think of
taking work home on the weekend. It's a safe bet that what you will get
done is less than what you planned. And not once; repeatedly. That's you
ignoring your experience when making an estimate.

So what *does* inform the estimate? You generate a mental image of
working at home. From this scenario, a sense of how much work you can do
on the weekend quickly and intuitively emerges. It feels true, so you go
with it. Yet that judgment is very likely wrong. That's because, in
constructing the scenario, you only imagine yourself
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_33 .pagebreak aria-label="33"
role="doc-pagebreak"}working. That narrow focus excludes all the people
and things around you that could intrude on your work time. In other
words, you are imagining a "best-case" scenario. That's typical. When
people are asked to make a "best-guess" scenario---the scenario most
likely to occur---what they come up with is generally indistinguishable
from what they settle on when asked for a "best-case"
scenario.^[20](#notes.xhtml#note_68){#chapter002.xhtml_not_68}^

Using a best-case scenario as the basis for an estimate is a really bad
idea because the best case is seldom the most likely way the future will
unfold. It's often not even probable. There is an almost infinite number
of things that could pop up during the weekend and eat into your work
time: illness, an accident, insomnia, a phone call from an old friend, a
family emergency, broken plumbing, and on down the list. This means that
the number of possible futures that could unfold on the weekend is vast
but in only one, the best-case scenario, are there no complications
cutting into your work time. So you shouldn't be surprised when Monday
morning comes and you didn't get as much done as you expected. But you
probably will be anyway.

If this sort of casual forecasting seems miles removed from the cost and
time estimates of big projects, think again. It's common for such
estimates to be made by breaking a project down into tasks, estimating
the time and cost of each task, then adding up the totals.
Experience---in the shape of past outcomes of similar projects---is
often ignored, and little or no careful consideration is given to the
many ways the forecasts could be knocked off-kilter. These are
effectively forecasts based on best-case scenarios---and they are about
as likely as your top-of-mind guess to prove accurate.

### [A BIAS AGAINST THINKING]{.sans} {.author-head1}

A preference for doing over talking---sometimes distilled into the
phrase "bias for action"---is an idea as common in business as it is
necessary. Wasted time can be dangerous. "Speed matters in
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_34 .pagebreak aria-label="34"
role="doc-pagebreak"}business," notes one of Amazon's famous leadership
principles, written by Jeff
Bezos.^[21](#notes.xhtml#note_69){#chapter002.xhtml_not_69}^ "Many
decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We
value calculated risk taking." Notice, however, that Bezos carefully
limited the bias for action to decisions that are "reversible." Don't
spend lots of time ruminating on those sorts of decisions, he advises.
Try something. If it doesn't work, reverse it, and try something else.
That's perfectly reasonable. It is also inapplicable to many decisions
on big projects because they are so difficult or expensive to reverse
that they are effectively irreversible: You can't build the Pentagon,
then knock it down and build it elsewhere after you discover that it
ruins the view.

When this bias for action is generalized into the culture of an
organization, the reversibility caveat is usually lost. What's left is a
slogan---"Just do it!"---that is seemingly applicable in all situations.
"When we surveyed participants in our executive education classes, we
found that managers feel more productive executing tasks than planning
them," observed business professors Francesca Gino and Bradley Staats.
"Especially when under time pressure, they perceive planning to be
wasted effort."^[22](#notes.xhtml#note_70){#chapter002.xhtml_not_70}^ To
put that in more general behavioral terms, people in power, which
includes executives deciding about big projects, prefer to go with the
quick flow of availability bias, as opposed to the slow effort of
planning.^[23](#notes.xhtml#note_71){#chapter002.xhtml_not_71}^
Executives everywhere will recognize that attitude. It isn't the bias
*for* action promoted by Jeff Bezos; it's a bias *against* thinking.

When laid out like that, it's obviously a bad idea. But remember that it
emerges from a desire to get going on a project, to see work happening,
to have tangible evidence of progress. That's good. Everyone involved in
a project should have that desire. It becomes trouble only when we
belittle planning as the annoying stuff we have to deal with before we
*really* get going on the project.

Planning *is* working on the project. Progress in planning *is*
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_35 .pagebreak aria-label="35"
role="doc-pagebreak"}progress on the project, often the most
cost-effective progress you can achieve. We lose sight of these facts at
our peril. Let's see why.

### [STRATEGIC MISREPRESENTATION]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The French architect Jean Nouvel, a winner of the Pritzker Architecture
Prize, architecture's Nobel, was blunt about the purpose of most cost
estimates for signature architecture. "In France, there is often a
theoretical budget that is given because it is the sum that politically
has been released to do something. In three out of four cases this sum
does not correspond to anything in technical terms. This is a budget
that was made because it could be accepted politically. The real price
comes later. The politicians make the real price public where they want
and when they
want."^[24](#notes.xhtml#note_72){#chapter002.xhtml_not_72}^ That's a
long way of saying that estimates aren't intended to be accurate; they
are intended to sell the project. In a word, they are lies---or spin, to
use more polite language.

An American politician said the quiet part out loud in a 2013 column for
the *San Francisco Chronicle* about transportation infrastructure in the
Bay Area. "News that the Transbay Terminal is something like \$300
million over budget should not come as a shock to anyone," wrote Willie
Brown, a former San Francisco mayor and California state assemblyman.
"We always knew the initial estimate was under the real cost. Just like
we never had a real cost for the Central Subway or the Bay Bridge or any
other massive construction project. So get off it. In the world of civic
projects, *the first budget is really just a down payment.* If people
knew the real cost from the start, nothing would ever be approved"
(italics added).^[25](#notes.xhtml#note_73){#chapter002.xhtml_not_73}^
Needless to say, Brown was retired from politics when he wrote that.

A senior transportation consultant once confided to me that oft-touted
"feasibility studies" serve more as cover for engineers than as
even-handed analysis. "In virtually all cases it was clear that the
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_36 .pagebreak aria-label="36"
role="doc-pagebreak"}engineers simply wanted to justify the project and
were looking to the traffic forecasts to help in the process." The only
goal was to get the project going. "I once asked an engineer why their
cost estimates were invariably underestimated and he simply answered,
'if we gave the true expected outcome costs nothing would be
built.'"^[26](#notes.xhtml#note_74){#chapter002.xhtml_not_74}^ It is not
a coincidence that that engineer's words were remarkably similar to
Brown's.

I've had executives from many different fields tell me about strategic
misrepresentation, but mostly in private conversation. The editor of a
major US architecture and design magazine even rejected an article I
pitched about strategic misrepresentation on the grounds that lying
about projects is so routine that his readers take it for granted, and
thus the article wouldn't be newsworthy. "Our country is littered with
big projects that fit your description," he wrote to
me.^[27](#notes.xhtml#note_75){#chapter002.xhtml_not_75}^ But that's in
private. In public, it's rare that people say it so baldly.

Rushed, superficial planning is no problem for the creation of a lowball
estimate. In fact, it can be enormously helpful. Problems and challenges
overlooked are problems and challenges that won't increase the estimate.

It also helps to express ironclad confidence in estimates, as Montreal
mayor Jean Drapeau did when he promised that the 1976 Olympic Games
would cost no more than what was budgeted. "The Montreal Olympics can no
more have a deficit than a man can have a baby," he
said.^[28](#notes.xhtml#note_76){#chapter002.xhtml_not_76}^ Future
embarrassment awaits when you talk like that. But that's for later.
After you get what you want. And maybe after you've retired.

### ["START DIGGING A HOLE"]{.sans} {.author-head1}

With contracts signed, the next step is to get shovels in the ground.
Fast. "The idea is to get going," concluded Willie Brown. "Start
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_37 .pagebreak aria-label="37"
role="doc-pagebreak"}digging a hole and make it so big, there's no
alternative to coming up with the money to fill it
in."^[29](#notes.xhtml#note_77){#chapter002.xhtml_not_77}^

It's a story at least as old as Hollywood. "My tactic was familiar to
directors who make films off the common path," wrote the film director
Elia Kazan---then retired, naturally---when he explained how he had
gotten Columbia Pictures to fund a movie he wanted to make in the late
1940s. "Get the work rolling, involve actors contractually, build sets,
collect props and costumes, expose negative, and so get the studio in
deep. Once money in some significant amount had been spent, it would be
difficult for Harry \[Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures\] to do
anything except scream and holler. If he suspended a film that had been
shooting for weeks, he'd be in for an irretrievable loss, not only of
money but of 'face.' The thing to do was to get the film
going."^[30](#notes.xhtml#note_78){#chapter002.xhtml_not_78}^

That type of behavior did in the legendary studio United Artists. In the
late 1970s, the red-hot young director Michael Cimino wanted to make
*Heaven's Gate,* an epic western, like *Lawrence of Arabia* set in
Wyoming. It would cost \$7.5 million (about \$30 million in 2021
dollars), at the high end of what movies cost in that era but reasonable
for an epic. United Artists asked him if he could meet a proposed
delivery schedule. He said he could. The studio signed the contracts.

Production started. In the first six days of shooting, the project fell
five days behind schedule. Cimino burned through sixty thousand feet of
film, which cost roughly \$900,000 to develop, and for that he had
produced "approximately a minute and a half of usable material,"
observed Steven Bach, the United Artists executive responsible for the
picture, in his book *Final Cut: Art, Money, and Ego in the Making of*
Heaven's Gate, *the Film That Sank United Artists,* which is one of the
most detailed and startling looks at a Hollywood production ever
written.^[31](#notes.xhtml#note_79){#chapter002.xhtml_not_79}^ That
should have set off alarm bells at United Artists. To be so far off
track a mere week into production strongly suggests that the original
estimates weren't worth the paper they were written on.

[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_38 .pagebreak aria-label="38"
role="doc-pagebreak"}But things only got worse. Time dragged on. Costs
exploded. Studio executives finally demanded that Cimino streamline the
production---and he told them to get lost. He would do things his way,
he said, and the executives would shut up and pay the bills. If they
didn't like it, they could tear up the contracts and he would take the
project to another studio. The executives backed down. They were furious
and terrified that the film was turning into a fiasco, but they were in
too deep to walk away. Cimino had them in the vise Kazan describes
above.

Today, *Heaven's Gate* is famous in Hollywood, but not in a good way. It
ultimately cost five times the initial estimate and opened a year late.
The critical reaction was so savage that Cimino withdrew the film,
reedited it, and released it again six months later. It bombed at the
box office. And United Artists was wiped out.

Cimino's star plunged as a result of the failure of *Heaven's Gate,* but
often the costs of out-of-control projects do not fall on those who
bring them about. When the Montreal Olympics went a spectacular 720
percent over budget, a cartoonist gleefully drew a heavily pregnant
Mayor Drapeau. But so what? Drapeau got his Olympics. And although it
took more than thirty years for Montreal to pay off the mountain of
debt, the onus was on the taxpayers of Montreal and Quebec. Drapeau
wasn't even voted out of office; he retired in
1986.^[32](#notes.xhtml#note_80){#chapter002.xhtml_not_80}^

### [DRIVING INTO THE BLIZZARD]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Yet there remains a nagging question about why strategic
misrepresentation works. Willie Brown wasn't strictly correct when he
wrote that once a hole is dug "there's no alternative" but to keep
paying for the project. In theory, the project could be scrapped and the
construction site sold. In theory, United Artists could have written off
*Heaven's Gate* and walked away when spending got out of control. But in
practice, Brown is right. Again scholars call this phenomenon "lock-in"
or "escalation of
commitment."^[33](#notes.xhtml#note_81){#chapter002.xhtml_not_81}^ If
escalation of commitment []{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_39 .pagebreak
aria-label="39" role="doc-pagebreak"}comes after the commitment fallacy,
there is overcommitment to the second degree. This typically spells
disaster, or at least a result vastly inferior to what could have been
achieved with a more thoughtful approach.

Why people spiral downward this way is an immensely important question
that psychologists, economists, political scientists, and sociologists
have studied for decades. A 2012 meta-analysis of the literature
included 120 citations even after excluding the many non-quantitative
analyses.^[34](#notes.xhtml#note_82){#chapter002.xhtml_not_82}^ Not
surprisingly, there is no simple explanation. But one element that is
central to any account is the "sunk cost fallacy."

Money, time, and effort previously spent to advance a project are lost
in the past. You can't get them back. They are "sunk." Logically, when
you decide whether to pour more resources into a project, you should
consider only whether doing so makes sense *now.* Sunk costs should not
be a factor in your thinking---but they probably will be because most
people find it incredibly hard to push them out of their minds. And so
people commonly "throw good money after bad," to use the old phrase.

Consider two friends with tickets for a professional basketball game a
long drive from where they live. On the day of the game, there is a big
snowstorm. The higher the price the friends paid for the tickets---their
sunk costs---the more likely they are to brave the blizzard and attempt
driving to the game, investing more time, money, and risk. In contrast,
the rational approach would be to disregard what they have already
invested and stay home. The sunk-cost fallacy applies to individuals,
groups, and whole
organizations.^[35](#notes.xhtml#note_83){#chapter002.xhtml_not_83}^

"Driving into the blizzard" is particularly common in politics.
Sometimes that's because politicians themselves fall for it. But even
politicians who know better understand that the public is likely to be
swayed by sunk costs, so sticking with a fallacy is politically safer
than making a logical decision. It's a safe bet that when California
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_40 .pagebreak aria-label="40"
role="doc-pagebreak"}governor Gavin Newsom decided not to scrap the
California High-Speed Rail project, only curtail it, he and his aides
were thinking very carefully about how sunk costs would weigh on the
public mind, and they knew that scrapping the project would be
interpreted by the public as "throwing away" the billions of dollars
already spent. As a result, the state's taxpayers were led to continue
to escalate their commitment and spend billions more on a shrunken
version of the project they would never have approved had it been put
before them in the first place.

I expect that California's "bullet train to nowhere" will one day be the
standard textbook illustration of the sunk-cost fallacy and escalation
of commitment.

### [SOMERVELL'S SPIRAL]{.sans} {.author-head1}

We can't know for sure which force---psychology or politics---led Brehon
Somervell to rush the planning of the Pentagon. But as usual with big
projects, there's reason to think that both played a role.

Like Willie Brown, Somervell was politically astute. He often "adjusted"
his plan, reducing the expected cost, number of floors, or square
footage, to suit what powerful people wanted to hear to give him the
approval he needed to get going. That would inevitably produce large
gaps between what was said and what was done, but "Somervell was little
concerned with cost overruns," as Steve Vogel
noted.^[36](#notes.xhtml#note_84){#chapter002.xhtml_not_84}^ And like
Willie Brown, Somervell was determined to "start digging a hole,"
knowing that the existence of a big enough hole would ensure his
project's future. Somervell was also steeped in a "can-do" army
engineering culture that prized System One decisiveness and getting
stuff done above all else.

We should be careful not to see psychology and politics as separate
forces; they can be mutually reinforcing and typically are in big
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_41 .pagebreak aria-label="41"
role="doc-pagebreak"}projects.^[37](#notes.xhtml#note_85){#chapter002.xhtml_not_85}^
When they align in favor of a superficial plan and a quick start, that's
probably what will occur---with predictable consequences.

When a group of determined critics of Somervell's plan pressed to move
the project to the superior Quartermaster Depot site, Somervell fought
back. He criticized the critics and insisted that only the Arlington
Farm site was suitable. As he drove his staff even harder to start
digging a hole at Arlington Farm, the critics urged the president to
intervene. He did, telling Somervell to switch sites. Incredibly,
Somervell still wouldn't quit. In a car with the president on the way to
visit the Quartermaster Depot site, he doggedly insisted that only the
Arlington Farm location was suitable and the president should change his
mind. "My dear general," Roosevelt finally said, "I'm still
commander-in-chief of the Army." In case that wasn't clear enough, he
wrapped up the visit by pointing to the Quartermaster site and saying,
"We're going to locate the War Department building over
there."^[38](#notes.xhtml#note_86){#chapter002.xhtml_not_86}^ That
finally settled it. Somervell sucked it up and accepted the inevitable.

In fairness, the fault for the botched initial plan did not lie entirely
with the general. Or perhaps even mostly. In that first, almost
comically rushed week, Somervell presented his plan to the secretary of
war, a congressional subcommittee, and the White House cabinet,
including the president. Each time, so few probing questions were asked
that the blatant flaws in the plan were not revealed. And each time, the
plan was quickly approved. Somervell's superiors simply didn't do their
jobs. The fact that the flaw was eventually exposed and the plan
stopped---in part because one of the determined critics of the plan
happened to be the president's uncle---only underscores their
dereliction of duty and the arbitrariness of the decision.

Such flaws in decision making are unfortunately not unique to the
Pentagon. Superficial planning is common and will be exposed only if
those with the authority to supervise and approve plans---including
[]{#chapter002.xhtml_Page_42 .pagebreak aria-label="42"
role="doc-pagebreak"}the general public when it comes to government
projects---exercise that power properly by subjecting plans to serious
questioning. Too often, they don't, preferring instead to accept a glib
story and "drive into the blizzard" as Somervell did. It's a lot easier.
And it may serve their individual interests. But the result will speak
for itself in its inferiority to what could have been achieved.

### [COMMIT TO NOT COMMIT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

But let's set aside history and generals. The lesson for us is as simple
as Somervell's initial mistake: Don't assume you know all there is to
know. If you're a project leader and people on your team make this
assumption---which is common---educate them or shift them out of the
team. Don't let yourself or them draw what appear to be obvious
conclusions. That sort of premature commitment puts you at risk of
missing not only glaring flaws but also opportunities that could make
your project much better than what you have in mind now.

In the next chapter, we'll turn from megaprojects to a home project and
see how another premature conclusion turned a simple kitchen renovation
into a disaster and years of misery for the family involved---and how
one of the world's most famous and successful buildings started with an
open mind, curiosity, and questions.

The process I lay out is anti-Somervell. It finds the flaws and the
opportunities. If you feel the urge to commit---and you probably
will---commit to completing that process before you draw conclusions
about your big
project.^[39](#notes.xhtml#note_87){#chapter002.xhtml_not_87}^ At first,
commit to having an open mind; that is, commit to not committing.

## THINK FROM RIGHT TO LEFT {.chapter-title}

::: ext2
*Projects are often started by jumping straight to a solution, even a
specific technology. That's the wrong place to begin. You want to start
by asking questions and considering alternatives. At the outset, always
assume that there is more to learn. Start with the most basic question
of all: Why?*
:::

David and Deborah's big project was to renovate their kitchen. As small
as that sounds, the kitchen was even smaller.

David and Deborah live on the first two floors of a four-story,
nineteenth-century brick town house in Cobble Hill, a charming Brooklyn
neighborhood that looks like the set of every movie ever filmed in New
York. The town houses in Cobble Hill are tall but cramped, with narrow
stairways and small rooms. David and Deborah's whole apartment was 1,200
square feet, and the kitchen was so tiny it could be a sailboat's
galley. Renovating it hardly seemed a challenge in the same league as
constructing the Empire State Building. Yet, unlike the Empire State
Building, David and Deborah's modest project came in late and over
budget. And not by a little; it was eighteen months late---and more than
half a million dollars over budget.

The root cause of that astonishing result was not a hurry to get work
under way. In fact, David and Deborah did the opposite of Brehon
Somervell's mad rush. Starting around 2011, they spent years musing
about renovating the kitchen. When they finally decided to get started,
they did not swing sledgehammers; they hired an
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_44 .pagebreak aria-label="44"
role="doc-pagebreak"}experienced architect. The architect suggested that
they knock out a wall between the kitchen and a small room to double the
size of the kitchen. They agreed to the modest expansion. The architect
then spent months preparing detailed drawings before he finally revealed
the plans. "He had a big roll of drawings," David recalled, "and
painstakingly he would take us through eight iterations of possible
designs, talking us through each one at great length and then explaining
why, however, this one isn't quite the right approach, so he would take
out the next sheet and show us a different design and conclude, 'But
really, this isn't the perfect solution, either, so let me show you
another version.'"

The total estimated cost of the carefully detailed project was
\$170,000. That's a lot, but everything in New York is expensive, so
David and Deborah decided to go ahead. They moved out, expecting to
return in three months.

"The project began to morph and unravel right at the beginning," David
recalled with a sigh. Standing in the kitchen, the contractor bounced up
and down to test the floorboards. He didn't like what he felt. When he
tore out the old kitchen and got a look at what was underneath, he saw
why: "Because of shoddy construction in the 1840s and no one ever fixing
it, there was not enough structural support to hold up this building."
The entire floor would have to be removed and steel beams and supports
installed in the basement.

When they were over the shock, David and Deborah thought about the
existing wooden floorboards. They were old and ugly. If they had to be
removed anyway, perhaps they should replace them rather than put them
back? The kitchen floor had to go regardless, "and what are you going to
do, have new wood on one half of the floor and not the other?" They
agreed to replace all the floorboards. David and Deborah also thought
about the living room's brick fireplace. It was an ugly, modern DIY job.
Why not take this chance to replace it?

And the fireplace wasn't the worst feature of the living room. There
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_45 .pagebreak aria-label="45"
role="doc-pagebreak"}was a tiny powder room under the stairs directly
beside the living room. David's mother said it was "vulgar." It would be
great to move that, David and Deborah thought, and easy to do while the
floor was out. "So the architect went back and redrew everything," David
recalled.

And since there would be work done in the basement, why not reroute the
cellar stairs to create a small room for a washer and dryer? "So that is
more design, more architectural drawings, more delays." Each new plan
also had to be filed with New York's notoriously byzantine bureaucracy.

There was nothing extravagant or whimsical about any of the changes.
Each was reasonable. Each led to the next. Besides, property values in
the neighborhood had soared, so they would get back at least some of the
money they had put into the apartment when they sold.

In that piecemeal way, the project expanded outward from the kitchen
until the first floor was entirely gutted, redesigned, and refiled.

But the project didn't stop there. The main bathroom on the second floor
was hideous and moldy. If you've moved out and got contractors working
on-site, David's mother said, why not fix that now so you don't have to
go through this again sometime down the road? Another reasonable
argument. And again, that change led to others. Which led to others.
Until the second floor was also entirely gutted, redesigned, and
refiled.

"The \$170,000 became \$400,000, then \$600,000 and \$700,000." David
pegs the final total at roughly \$800,000. It's a bill so large that
David will probably have to postpone his retirement. And that figure
doesn't account for the dislocation of their lives. Instead of the three
months' wait they had expected, David and Deborah moved back in a year
and a half after they'd left.

When the job was finally done, everyone agreed the fully renovated
apartment was quite lovely. But that was small consolation. If the
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_46 .pagebreak aria-label="46"
role="doc-pagebreak"}project had been planned from the start as the
bottom-to-top renovation it became, there would have been one plan, one
filing with the city, and the contractor could have tackled the work in
the most efficient order. The cost---in dollars, time, and
aggravation---would have been much lower than what David and Deborah
paid. No matter how you look at it, the project was a disaster.

### [WHY?]{.sans} {.author-head1}

David's thinking was indisputably slow, and the architect's work was
painstaking. Yet the plan---I'll be polite---was not good. This
underscores a critical point about my advice to "think slow."

Slow isn't good in itself. Like David and Deborah, people can spend
years daydreaming about a project but have nothing more than daydreams
to show for it, just as organizations can burn enormous amounts of time
holding meetings filled with meandering discussions that never go
anywhere. Moreover, careful analysis like that done by David's architect
can be laborious and take ages, but if it is too narrowly focused, it
won't reveal fundamental flaws in the plan or gaps, much less correct
them. And by its impressive detail, it may give the false idea that the
overall plan is stronger than it is, like a beautiful facade with no
structure behind it. Governments and bureaucratic corporations are good
at churning out this sort of analysis. It is a major reason why the
California High-Speed Rail project was able to spend more than a decade
"in planning" before construction began, producing impressive quantities
of paper and numbers without delivering a plan worthy of the name.

In contrast, good planning explores, imagines, analyzes, tests, and
iterates. That takes time. Thus, slow is a consequence of doing planning
right, not a cause. The cause of good planning is the range and depth of
the questions it asks and the imagination and the rigor of the
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_47 .pagebreak aria-label="47"
role="doc-pagebreak"}answers it delivers. Notice that I put "questions"
before "answers." It's self-evident that questions come before answers.
Or rather, it *should* be self-evident. Unfortunately, it's not.
Projects routinely start with answers, not questions.

David and Deborah's project started with "renovate the kitchen." That's
an answer, not a question. As so often happens with projects, the goal
of the project seemed obvious, a given. The only question was when to go
ahead with the project, and once that was decided, it was time to get
into detailed planning. The failure to ask questions about the goal of
the project was the root cause of its failure.

Frank Gehry, arguably the world's most acclaimed architect, never starts
with answers. "I grew up with the Talmud," he told me when I interviewed
him in 2021, "and the Talmud starts with a question." That's typical of
Judaism, he says. "Jews question
everything."^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_88){#chapter003.xhtml_not_88}^

What Gehry means by questioning isn't doubting or criticizing, much less
attacking or tearing down. He means asking questions with an open-minded
desire to learn. It is, in a word, exploration. "You're being curious,"
he says. That's the opposite of the natural inclination to think that
What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI), the fallacy we saw in the
previous chapter. In contrast, Gehry assumes that there *must* be more
to learn. By making that assumption, he avoids the trap of the fallacy.

In this frame of mind, the first thing Gehry does when he meets with
potential clients is engage in long conversations. This isn't chitchat
or Gehry being personable, and it doesn't involve his delivering
lectures about architectural theory or dwelling on the visions bubbling
in his imagination. Instead, he asks questions. With no motive but
curiosity, he explores the client's needs, aspirations, fears, and
everything else that has brought them to his door. The whole
conversation starts with a simple question: "Why are you doing this
project?"

Few projects start this way. All should.

### []{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_48 .pagebreak aria-label="48" role="doc-pagebreak"}[THE BOX ON THE RIGHT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Frank Gehry's most celebrated building---the one that elevated him from
the ranks of rising stars to the pinnacle of the architecture world---is
the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. A gallery of contemporary art in Bilbao,
Spain, it is a spectacular, glowing building unlike anything seen
before, as much of an artwork as those on display inside.

Understandably, the Guggenheim Bilbao is often portrayed as the product
of nothing more than the architect's imagination and genius. More
cynical observers see it as an example of the "starchitect" phenomenon,
in which architects give free rein to their inflated egos and
idiosyncrasies. Both depictions are wrong.

When Gehry was first approached in the 1990s to consider the project, he
flew to Bilbao and met with officials from the government of the Basque
Country, an autonomous region in northern Spain. The government was the
would-be client, having created a plan that would see it pay the Solomon
R. Guggenheim Foundation to create and run a Guggenheim Museum in
Bilbao, the Basque Country's largest city. Officials had selected an
elegant but abandoned building, originally built in 1909 as a wine
warehouse, to be the future home of the museum. Would Gehry consider
doing the renovation?

Another architect might have simply said "No, thanks" and walked away.
Or "Yes" and gotten to work---just as David and Deborah's architect did.
Not Gehry; he asked questions, starting with the fundamental one: "Why
are you doing this project?"

The Basque Country was once a hub of heavy industry and shipping, he was
told. But that was in the past. "Bilbao was, like, not quite as bad as
Detroit but almost," he recalled years later. "Steel industry gone.
Shipping industry gone. It looked pretty
sad."^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_89){#chapter003.xhtml_not_89}^ Bilbao was
rusting and remote, and few foreigners had even heard of it, so it
didn't benefit from the enormous flow of tourists that annually flooded
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_49 .pagebreak aria-label="49"
role="doc-pagebreak"}southern Spain and Madrid. A Guggenheim, officials
hoped, would draw visitors to Bilbao and invigorate the economy. The
officials told Gehry that they wanted a building that could do for
Bilbao and the Basque Country what the Sydney Opera House had done for
Sydney and Australia: put them on the map and bring back
growth.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_90){#chapter003.xhtml_not_90}^

Gehry inspected the old warehouse. He liked the building, but not for a
project with that goal. The building would have to be torn down and
replaced, he said. And that would be a shame when it could be put to
good use some other way.

Gehry had another idea, however. He had spotted a derelict industrial
site on the riverfront that had good sight lines in many directions.
Forget the renovation, he said. Build a new, dazzling museum on that
riverfront site.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_91){#chapter003.xhtml_not_91}^

The officials agreed. And for good reason; their goal of boosting the
economy was ambitious, requiring an increase in tourism. A new
Guggenheim in a renovated building could perhaps deliver that in theory.
But how likely was that? Has any renovation, however brilliant, ever
created a global splash that drew people in large numbers from all over
the world? It's hard to think of one. But dramatic new buildings in
impressive locations can and do attract global attention. A few have
even drawn visitors in major numbers, such as the Sydney Opera House. It
would still be an enormous challenge, but that approach seemed more
likely to deliver what the Basques wanted, or so Gehry argued.

The resulting building thrilled architecture critics and ordinary people
alike, and the Guggenheim Bilbao was an overnight sensation. Tourists
flooded the city. And they brought money. In the first three years of
operation, almost 4 million people visited the once obscure corner of
Spain, injecting a little less than \$1 billion (in 2021 dollars) into
the region.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_92){#chapter003.xhtml_not_92}^

Frank Gehry's imagination, genius, and ego were certainly involved in
the creation of the Guggenheim Bilbao. But the building was
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_50 .pagebreak aria-label="50"
role="doc-pagebreak"}fundamentally shaped by the project's goal. As
Gehry's record shows, he is perfectly capable of designing buildings
that are modest and understated relative to what he did in Bilbao. In
fact, he even did an understated museum renovation in Philadelphia,
years later.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_93){#chapter003.xhtml_not_93}^ But
what the client wanted to achieve in Bilbao called for much more than
that, so he put the museum where it is and made it the way it is because
that would best achieve the project's goal.

Projects are not goals in themselves. Projects are how goals are
achieved. People don't build skyscrapers, hold conferences, develop
products, or write books for their own sakes. They do these things in
order to accomplish other things.

That's a simple and self-evident idea, but it is easily and commonly
forgotten when the WYSIATI fallacy from chapter 2 rushes us to a
conclusion that seems so obvious it's not even worth discussing. If I
had asked David and Deborah at the start of their project what their
goal was, they likely would have shrugged and said something like "To
have a nice kitchen." That is what people say when they confuse means
and ends.

At the beginning of a project, we need to disrupt the psychology-driven
dash to a premature conclusion by disentangling means and ends and
thinking carefully about what exactly we want to accomplish. Frank
Gehry's question, "Why are you doing this project?," does that.

Picture politicians who want to connect an island to the mainland. How
much would a bridge cost? Where should it be located? How long would it
take to build? If they discuss all this in detail, they are likely to
feel they have done excellent planning when, in fact, they started with
an answer---a bridge is the best solution---and proceeded from there. If
they instead explored *why* they want to connect the island to the
mainland---to reduce commuting time, to increase tourism, to provide
faster access to emergency healthcare, whatever---they would focus first
on the *ends* and only then shift to discussing the
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_51 .pagebreak aria-label="51"
role="doc-pagebreak"}*means* for achieving those ends, which would be
the right order of things. That's how new ideas surface: What about a
tunnel? Ferries? A helipad? There are lots of ways to connect an island
with the mainland and meet a need. Depending on the goal, it may not
even have to be a physical connection. Excellent broadband service may
do what is required, and more, at a fraction of the cost. "Connecting"
the island might not even be necessary or advisable. If access to
emergency healthcare is the concern, for example, the best option may be
installing that service on the island. But none of this will come to
light if the discussion starts with an answer.

Developing a clear, informed understanding of what the goal is and
why---and never losing sight of it from beginning to end---is the
foundation of a successful project.

In project planning, a standard tool is a flowchart that lays out, from
left to right, what needs to be done and when, with the project
concluding when the goal is achieved in the final box on the right. That
simple concept is also valuable in the initial planning stages because
it can help us visualize a project not as an end in itself but as a
means to an end: The goal is the box on the right. That's where project
planning must begin by asking Frank Gehry's question and thoughtfully
exploring what should go in that box. Once that is settled, you can
shift to considering what should go into the boxes on the left---the
means that will best get you to your goal.

I call this "thinking from right to left." But many other people working
in different fields have identified similar notions and used different
language to describe what is fundamentally the same idea.

"Backcasting" is used in urban and environmental planning. Originally
developed by University of Toronto professor John B. Robinson to deal
with energy problems, backcasting starts by developing a detailed
description of a desirable future state; then you work backwards to
tease out what needs to happen for that imagined future to become
reality.^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_94){#chapter003.xhtml_not_94}^ One
backcasting exercise that looked at California's
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_52 .pagebreak aria-label="52"
role="doc-pagebreak"}water needs started by imagining an ideal
California twenty-five years in the future, then asked what would have
to happen---to supply, consumption rates, conservation, and so on---to
make that happy outcome
real.^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_95){#chapter003.xhtml_not_95}^

"Theory of change" is a similar process often used by government
agencies and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that seek social
change, such as boosting literacy rates, improving sanitation, or better
protecting human rights. Again, it starts by defining the goal and only
then considers courses of action that could produce that outcome.

Silicon Valley is far removed from these worlds, yet the same basic idea
is widely used in technology circles. "You've got to start with the
customer experience and work backwards to the technology," Steve Jobs
told the audience at Apple's 1997 Worldwide Developers Conference. "You
can't start with the technology and try to figure out how you're going
to try to sell it. I made this mistake probably more than anybody in
this room, and I've got the scar tissue to prove
it."^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_96){#chapter003.xhtml_not_96}^ Today, "work
backwards" is a mantra in Silicon Valley.

### [LOSING SIGHT OF THE RIGHT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The most common way in which thinking from right to left fails is losing
sight of the right, the goal. Even Steve Jobs committed this error after
insisting on the opposite: that projects have to start with the customer
experience and work backwards to the technology. The most notorious
example was Apple's Power Mac G4 Cube computer. Released in 2000, the G4
was a translucent cube that even today looks gorgeously futuristic. It
had no power switch. You just waved your hand, and it turned on. So
cool. So Steve Jobs. And that was the problem. The G4 had not been
designed by looking at who Apple's customers were and what would serve
them best. Its combination of cost, capabilities, and aesthetics was
molded by Steve Jobs's passions, and impressive as the machine was, it
was an awkward fit for []{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_53 .pagebreak
aria-label="53" role="doc-pagebreak"}customers. The G4 flopped, and
Apple scrapped it a year later at great
cost.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_97){#chapter003.xhtml_not_97}^

But "work backwards" also fails when planners aren't compelled to nail
down what's in that final flowchart box on the right and forced to think
from right to left. Without that, it's easy to get consumed by the
blizzard of details and difficulties that arise during the planning of
any project, while the goal, which was only vaguely understood to begin
with, fades from view. Then the project can veer off in unpredictable
directions, as David and Deborah's kitchen renovation did so
spectacularly.

Jeff Bezos was well aware of that danger, and he came up with an elegant
way to keep Amazon focused on customers, which is the company's primary
creed. Bezos noted that when a project is successfully completed and
it's ready to be publicly announced, the conventional last step is to
have the communications department write two documents. One is a very
short press release (PR) that summarizes what the new product or service
is and why it is valuable for customers. The other is a "frequently
asked questions" (FAQ) document with more details about costs,
functionality, and other concerns. Bezos's brainstorm was to make that
*last* step in a conventional project the *first* step in Amazon
projects.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_98){#chapter003.xhtml_not_98}^

To pitch a new project at Amazon, you must first write a PR and FAQ,
putting the goal smack in the opening sentences of the press release.
Everything that happens subsequently is working backwards from the
PR/FAQ, as it is called at Amazon. Critically, the language of both
documents must be plain. "I called it 'Oprah-speak,'" says Ian
McAllister, a former Amazon executive who wrote multiple PR/FAQs for
Jeff Bezos.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_99){#chapter003.xhtml_not_99}^ "You
know, Oprah would have someone on her show who would say something, and
Oprah would turn to her audience and explain it in a very simple way
that anyone can understand." With language like that, flaws can't be
hidden behind jargon, slogans, or technical terms. Thinking is laid
bare. If a thought is fuzzy, ill []{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_54 .pagebreak
aria-label="54" role="doc-pagebreak"}considered, or illogical, or if it
is based on unsupported assumptions, a careful reader will see it.

Projects are pitched in a one-hour meeting with top executives. Amazon
forbids PowerPoint presentations and all the usual tools of the
corporate world, so copies of the PR/FAQ are handed around the table and
everyone reads it, slowly and carefully, in silence. Then they share
their initial thoughts, with the most senior people speaking last to
avoid prematurely influencing others. Finally, the writer goes through
the documents line by line, with anyone free to speak up at any time.
"This discussion of the details is the critical part of the meeting,"
wrote Colin Bryar and Bill Carr, two former Amazon executives. "People
ask hard questions. They engage in intense debate and discussion of the
key ideas and the way they are
expressed."^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_100){#chapter003.xhtml_not_100}^

The writer of the PR/FAQ then takes the feedback into account, writes
another draft, and brings it back to the group. The same process unfolds
again. And again. And again. Everything about the proposal is tested and
strengthened through multiple iterations. And because it's a
participatory process with the relevant people deeply involved from the
beginning, it ensures that the concept that finally emerges is seen with
equal clarity in the minds of everyone from the person proposing the
project to the CEO. Everyone is on the same page from the start.

But no process is foolproof. When Jeff Bezos dreamed up the idea of a 3D
phone display that would allow control by gestures in the air (the
hand-waving again!), he fell in love with the concept. Later, he
effectively co-authored the PR/FAQ that would launch the Amazon Fire
Phone project. Bill Carr, an ex--vice president of digital media at
Amazon, recalled wondering when he first heard about the Fire Phone in
2012 why anyone would want a battery-draining 3D display on a
phone.^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_101){#chapter003.xhtml_not_101}^ But work
pressed on, occupying more than a thousand employees. When the Fire
Phone was released in June 2014 at a price of \$200, it didn't sell. The
price was cut in half. Then the phone []{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_55
.pagebreak aria-label="55" role="doc-pagebreak"}was free. Amazon
couldn't give it away. A year later, it was discontinued and hundreds of
millions of dollars were written off. "It failed for all the reasons we
said it was going to fail---that's the crazy thing about it," said a
software engineer. Asking "Why?" can work only where people feel free to
speak their minds and the decision makers really listen. "Many employees
who worked on the Fire Phone had serious doubts about it," concluded the
journalist and author Brad Stone, who has written definitive histories
of Amazon, "but no one, it seemed, had been brave or clever enough to
take a stand and win an argument with their obstinate
leader."^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_102){#chapter003.xhtml_not_102}^

Thinking from right to left is demanding because it's not natural.
What's natural is WYSIATI---What You See Is All There Is---and focusing
exclusively on what is in front of you. And when you are obsessed with a
cool idea or you are deep into designing the project or buried in a
thousand and one details, the box on the right is nowhere to be seen.
That's when trouble starts.

Robert Caro can help with that.

Caro is the greatest living American biographer, famous for long, deeply
researched, massively complex books about President Lyndon B. Johnson
and Robert Moses, the man who built New York, which take as much as a
decade or more to write. He starts all his mammoth projects the same
way: He fills in the box on the right.

"What is this book about?," he asks himself. "What is its point?" He
forces himself to "boil the book down to three paragraphs, or two, or
one."^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_103){#chapter003.xhtml_not_103}^ These
paragraphs express the narrative theme with perfect simplicity.

But don't mistake simple for easy. Caro writes a draft and throws it
out. Then another. And another, in seemingly endless iterations. This
can go on for weeks as he compares his summary with his voluminous
research. "The whole time, I'm saying to myself, 'no, that's not exactly
what you're trying to do in this book.'" He gets into foul moods. "I
come home and \[my wife\] doesn't even want to see me for the first
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_56 .pagebreak aria-label="56"
role="doc-pagebreak"}several hours." But the struggle is worth it. When
he finally has his precious paragraphs, he pins them to the wall behind
his desk, where it is literally impossible for him to lose sight of his
goal.

In the long years ahead, as he writes his book, pushing ever deeper into
the jungle of his research, in growing danger of getting lost in its
complexity, Caro constantly looks at his summary and compares it with
what he is currently writing. "Is this fitting in with those three
paragraphs?," he asks himself. "How is it fitting in? What you wrote is
good, but it's not fitting in. So you have to throw it away or find a
way to make it fit in."

With the goal always in view, there is no getting lost. That's thinking
from right to left.

### [BACK TO COBBLE HILL]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Let's imagine that it's 2011. David and Deborah are sitting in their
little kitchen, drinking coffee and talking about the kitchen
renovation. How should that conversation go in order to give the project
a sound foundation? It should start with Frank Gehry's question: Why are
you doing this project?

They would probably start with the obvious, something like "It would be
nice to spend more time cooking in the kitchen." But that's the surface.
They need to go deeper. For whom will they cook? If it's guests, are
they close family? Friends? Business acquaintances? Why do they want to
do more of that?

So what should go into the box on the right? That can't be decided
without getting into lots more detail about David and Deborah's lives,
aspirations, and priorities. But one possibility is "more entertaining
at home." That should be elaborated upon. Why are they entertaining? The
project needs a clear, explicit goal. That cannot be settled casually;
it's what the whole project is about, and it must be treated
accordingly.

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_57 .pagebreak aria-label="57"
role="doc-pagebreak"}If the goal is entertaining at home more, how would
David and Deborah best achieve it? They can't do that without a kitchen
renovation. But will that get them to their goal? Guests will use not
only the kitchen but also the living room, with its ugly DIY fireplace,
and that awful powder room. If that thought makes them cringe, they have
discovered that the scruffiness of the kitchen is not the only barrier
to their goal. They also need to move the powder room and redo the
fireplace.

By carefully working through what must be done to get to their goal, the
logic that surfaced midconstruction and convinced David and Deborah to
make piecemeal expansions of the project will instead surface up front
in a conversation about what other renovations they might consider. And
if major work is under way and they would have to move out anyway, would
it not make sense to also consider other work they might want to do in
the future? To get it all over with at once. Plus it's cheaper to have
workers come on-site once and do many jobs rather than come back
multiple times.

If the scope of the project expands this way---in conversation,
remember, not in reality---it will surely raise the question of money.
Can they afford this? That depends not only on their present finances
but also on their future plans. Property values are way up since they
moved in, so they could get back some of the money when they sell the
apartment. But *will* they sell the apartment? Do they intend to stay
there until the ends of their careers? Where will they live when they
retire? These decisions may be too far off to be of concern, or they may
be important considerations. They can know only by bringing them up and
discussing them.

Maybe the conversation would lead David and Deborah to expand the
project a little. Or a lot. Maybe they would decide that the project
should have a more ambitious goal---something like "making time at home
more enjoyable in all aspects and raising the value of the apartment to
its full market potential"---and conclude that they should do a
top-to-bottom renovation.

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_58 .pagebreak aria-label="58"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Or maybe they would look at the cost, their
finances, and their retirement plans, and scale it back. Maybe they
would decide it would be too expensive to do fully and not worth doing
partially, so they'd call the whole thing off.

Maybe they'll decide that the farmhouse where they spend their summers
is where they should put their money. Or that instead of making capital
improvements, they should invest the money.

But there are two things we can be certain of: Had they asked these
questions, David and Deborah would never have decided to do the
renovation the way they did. And every one of the possible approaches
would have produced an outcome superior to what they got. Planning would
have been done once. Plans would have been filed once. The work would
have been done in the most efficient order, faster. And only once. The
project would have cost David and Deborah far less money, time, and
pain.

More fundamentally, the project would not have gotten out of control and
would have remained the product of their informed choices. Instead of
something that happened to them, it would have been something they made
happen.

### [POSTSCRIPT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

In writing this chapter, I omitted a substantial piece of the
David-and-Deborah story. Recall that the town house is four stories plus
a basement. David and Deborah own only the bottom two floors and the
basement. Their neighbors own the top two floors. David and Deborah were
legally obligated to get their neighbors to sign off on their proposed
kitchen renovation, and they did, but they and their neighbors did not
seriously discuss their plan, much less what they might do jointly
within what is, after all, a single small building.

That was unfortunate, because after David and Deborah had gone through
eighteen months of hell, their neighbors saw the finished
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_Page_59 .pagebreak aria-label="59"
role="doc-pagebreak"}apartment, liked the look of it, and decided to do
the same thing, the same way. Like David and Deborah, they didn't
carefully decide what goal should go into the box on the right. Like
David and Deborah, they didn't carefully think about the best means of
achieving that end. They even hired David and Deborah's contractor.

The result was the same, except that it was spread out over two more
agonizing years. The work upstairs showered the downstairs apartment
with dust and occasionally caused damage. Deborah couldn't take it. She
moved out for the duration. At one point, David spent three months in
the dark because sheets of plywood covered his windows. He finally got
fed up and stayed with a friend for a year. Work that had been done in
the first renovation had to be torn out and redone in the second. The
bleakest moment was when the neighbors discovered that the building's
brick facade was in danger of crumbling, which required that all the
bricks be removed and relaid. David and Deborah's portion of that bill
came to \$180,000.

By David's rough estimate, he and Deborah and their neighbors spent a
total approaching \$1 million *each* renovating the little town house.
If someone had suggested doing that at the start, he says, they would
have called it "crazy." But that's where they got to, paradoxically,
because they started the project "locked into a limited vision of what
we wanted to achieve," in David's words. That lock-in wouldn't have
happened if David and Deborah had started their project with Gehry-style
questions and some hard right-to-left thinking---and included their
neighbors in the discussion. But they didn't.

It was only a small kitchen renovation, after all. What could go wrong?

## PIXAR PLANNING {.chapter-title}

::: ext2
*People are terrible at getting things right the first time. But we're
great at tinkering. Wise planners make the most of this basic insight
into human nature. They try, learn, and do it again. They plan like
Pixar and Frank Gehry do.*
:::

This is a tale of two masterpieces.

The first stands on a rocky outcrop of Sydney Harbor on the Australian
coast. The Sydney Opera House is a collage of graceful white curves that
call to mind billowing sails, clouds, or bird wings. Defying mass and
scale, the building elevates you. It feels light and joyous, as if it
may just lift off in the wind. When it was completed half a century ago,
it astonished. Nothing like it had been seen before. The opera house
became a proud national symbol and an international treasure. "It stands
by itself as one of the indisputable masterpieces of human creativity,"
declared an expert evaluation report commissioned by UNESCO. In 2007, it
was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site, alongside the Taj Mahal and
the Great Wall of China, a first for a building whose architect was
still alive.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_104){#chapter004.xhtml_not_104}^

We have already encountered the second masterpiece. It is the Guggenheim
Museum Bilbao. The renowned American sculptor Richard Serra called it
"one of the greatest achievements of architecture in the twentieth
century."^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_105){#chapter004.xhtml_not_105}^ When a
2010 survey asked the world's leading architects and architecture
experts to name the most important works since 1980, the Guggenheim
Bilbao was by far the top
choice.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_106){#chapter004.xhtml_not_106}^

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_61 .pagebreak aria-label="61"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Many people consider the Sydney Opera House and the
Guggenheim Museum Bilbao the greatest buildings of the past century. I
agree.

The design of the Sydney Opera House sprang from genius. The architect
was Jørn Utzon, a relative unknown when he won the global competition to
conceive it.

The Guggenheim Bilbao was also the product of genius. Designed by Frank
Gehry, it is arguably the greatest work of an architect so original that
the only category he can be placed in is his own.

But there is one difference between these two buildings. And it is a big
one.

The construction of the Sydney Opera House was an outright fiasco.
Setbacks piled up. Costs exploded. Scheduled to take five years to
build, it took fourteen. The final bill was 1,400 percent over the
estimate, one of the largest cost overruns for a building in history.
Worse, the Sydney Opera House destroyed Jørn Utzon's career.

The Guggenheim Bilbao was delivered on time and on budget. To be
precise, it cost 3 percent *less* than
expected.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_107){#chapter004.xhtml_not_107}^ And as
we saw in the previous chapter, it produced the expected benefits and
more, giving the project very select company in the only 0.5 percent of
big projects that deliver on all promises. That success vaulted Frank
Gehry to the top tier of the world's architects, leading to many more
commissions and a vast and distinguished body of work all over the
world.

There is much to learn from that contrast.

### [*EXPERIRI*]{.sans} {.author-head1}

"Planning" is a concept with baggage. For many, it calls to mind a
passive activity: sitting, thinking, staring into space, abstracting
what you're going to do. In its more institutional form, planning is a
bureaucratic exercise in which the planner writes reports, colors maps
and []{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_62 .pagebreak aria-label="62"
role="doc-pagebreak"}charts, programs activities, and fills in boxes on
flowcharts. Such plans often look like train schedules, but they're even
less interesting.

Much planning does fit that bill. And that's a problem because it's a
serious mistake to treat planning as an exercise in abstract,
bureaucratic thought and calculation. What sets good planning apart from
the rest is something completely different. It is captured by a Latin
verb, *experiri. Experiri* means "to try," "to test," or "to prove." It
is the origin of two wonderful words in English: *experiment* and
*experience.*

Think of how people typically learn: We tinker. We try this. We try
that. We see what works and what doesn't. We iterate. We learn. This is
experimentation creating experience. Or, to use the phrase of theorists,
it is "experiential learning." We're good at learning by
tinkering---which is fortunate, because we're terrible at getting things
right the first time.

Tinkering sometimes requires tenacity, and it always requires a
willingness to learn from failure. "I have not failed ten thousand
times," Thomas Edison said. "I've successfully found ten thousand ways
that will not work." That wasn't hyperbole. Merely to figure out how to
make a low-cost, long-lasting filament for a lightbulb, Edison had to
churn through hundreds of experiments with different substances before
he found the one---carbonized bamboo---that
worked.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_108){#chapter004.xhtml_not_108}^

Experimentation in planning requires a simulation of the project to
come. With that, you can make changes in the simulation and see what
happens. Changes that work---changes that will get you to the box on the
right---are kept. Those that don't are chucked. With many iterations and
serious testing, the simulation evolves into a plan that is creative,
rigorous, and detailed, which is to say, a *reliable* plan.

The genius of our species, however, is that we can learn not only from
our own experience but that of others. Edison himself started his
experiments on lightbulb filaments by studying the results of the many
other scientists and inventors who had tried to create an efficient
lightbulb before him. And once he had cracked the problem,
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_63 .pagebreak aria-label="63"
role="doc-pagebreak"}anyone could skip the experiments, study what he
had done, and make a working lightbulb.

Still, even if I know Edison's solution to the lightbulb problem, my
first attempt to make a working lightbulb will almost surely be a
struggle. It will be slow, and my lightbulb may not work well. So I do
it again. And I get a little better. And I do it again and again and
again. And I get a lot better. That's called a "positive learning
curve": Things get easier, cheaper, and more effective with each
iteration.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_109){#chapter004.xhtml_not_109}^ This,
too, is experience, and it is invaluable. As the old Latin saying goes,
"*Repetitio est mater studiorum*"---"Repetition is the mother of
learning."

A good plan is one that meticulously applies experimentation or
experience. A great plan is one that rigorously applies both. In this
chapter, I'll look at how to use experimentation in planning; in the
next chapter, experience.

### ["A MAGNIFICENT DOODLE"]{.sans} {.author-head1}

A bad plan is one that applies neither experimentation nor experience.
The plan for the Sydney Opera House was *very* bad.

The Australian art critic Robert Hughes described Jørn Utzon's entry in
the design competition as "nothing more than a magnificent
doodle."^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_110){#chapter004.xhtml_not_110}^ That's a
little exaggerated, but not much. Utzon's entry was so sparse that it
didn't even satisfy all the technical requirements set by the
organizers, but his simple sketches were indisputably
brilliant---perhaps too brilliant. They mesmerized the jury and swept
objections aside, leaving a host of unanswered questions.

The principal mystery lay in the curved shells at the heart of Utzon's
vision. They were beautiful on two-dimensional paper, but what
three-dimensional constructs would enable them to stand? What materials
would they be made of? How would they be built? None of that had been
figured out. Utzon hadn't even consulted engineers.

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_64 .pagebreak aria-label="64"
role="doc-pagebreak"}At that point, the organizers of the competition
should have congratulated Utzon on his vision and asked him to take
whatever time was necessary to experiment with his ideas and draw on the
experience of others to develop a serious plan. With that in hand, cost
and time estimates could have been made, budgets authorized, and
construction begun. That would have been a "Think slow, act fast"
approach. But that's not what happened; the opposite did. The Sydney
Opera House is an exemplary case of "Think fast, act slow."

The key force behind the opera house project was Joe Cahill, the premier
of the state of New South Wales. Cahill had held office for many years
and was ill with cancer. Like so many politicians before and since, his
thoughts turned to his legacy. And like other politicians before and
since, he decided that the public policies he had ushered in were not
enough, that his legacy must take the tangible form of a grand building.
But Cahill's Australian Labor Party colleagues did not share his dream.
New South Wales faced a severe shortage of housing and schools, and
pouring public money into an expensive opera house struck them as folly.

Facing a classic political dilemma, Cahill chose a classic political
strategy: He lowballed the cost, helped in part by an estimate prepared
for the contest judges that simply filled the large blanks in the plan
with optimistic assumptions and concluded that Utzon's design was the
cheapest of the leading contenders.

And Cahill rushed the process. He decreed that construction would start
in February 1959, whatever the state of planning. Not coincidentally, an
election was due in March 1959. He even instructed his officials to
start building and "make such progress that no one who succeeds me can
stop this."^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_111){#chapter004.xhtml_not_111}^ It
was the "start digging a hole" strategy discussed in chapter 2. And it
worked for Cahill. By October 1959, he was dead, but the opera house was
alive and under construction---although no one knew precisely what they
were building because the final design had not been decided and drawn.

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_65 .pagebreak aria-label="65"
role="doc-pagebreak"}As Jørn Utzon worked, he saw that the challenges
ahead were many and daunting, which would have been fine if the project
had existed solely on his drafting table. But with construction ongoing,
it was only a matter of time until unresolved problems and nasty
surprises would surface and plunge the project deeper and deeper into
delays and red ink. Utzon labored mightily, and he ultimately did crack
the puzzle of how to build the curved shells, substituting an ingenious
but substantially more upright design than the one he had first
sketched.^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_112){#chapter004.xhtml_not_112}^ But by
then, it was much too late to avoid disaster.

Thanks mostly to the rushed start of construction, all that went up
rapidly was the cost. Completed work even had to be dynamited and
cleared away to start again. Inevitably, the project became a political
scandal. The new minister in charge, who despised Utzon, bullied and
harassed him and even deprived him of his fees. In 1966, Utzon was
effectively pushed out and replaced in the middle of construction, with
the shells barely erected and no interior work
done.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_113){#chapter004.xhtml_not_113}^ He and his
family left Australia in secret, slipping aboard a plane just minutes
before the doors closed to avoid the press.

When the opera house was finally opened by Queen Elizabeth II in October
1973, it was acoustically unsuited for opera and internally flawed in
many other ways thanks to the shambolic process of its creation and the
dismissal of its creator. The man whose vision had created the soaring
structure was not even present at the ceremonies, and his name was not
mentioned.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_114){#chapter004.xhtml_not_114}^

Utzon never returned to Australia. He died in 2008, never having beheld
his completed masterpiece with his own eyes. It's a tragedy fit for
opera.

### [THE BUMP THAT REDEFINED ARCHITECTURE]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The story of how the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao came into existence is
much less dramatic---and much happier. Although it was
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_66 .pagebreak aria-label="66"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Gehry who convinced officials in Bilbao to build a
new museum on the riverfront site, he still had to win the competition
to design it. To develop his entry, he went through an intensive period
of what he calls "play"---trying out ideas. In its simplest form, Gehry
sketches ideas on paper with scrawls that would be mystifying to anyone
who didn't know what he was working on. But mostly he works with models,
starting with wooden building blocks of various sizes that he stacks
first one way, then another, looking for something that seems functional
and visually pleasing. Working with Edwin Chan, an architect at Gehry's
firm, Gehry started with a preliminary block model, then added scraps of
white paper twisted into various shapes. He studied each change intently
and discussed whether it should be kept or removed. Assistants built a
new model of wood and cardboard, and the process was repeated. "There
were often multiple models in a single day, as Frank would test and
reject various ideas in quick succession," wrote Paul Goldberger,
Gehry's
biographer.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_115){#chapter004.xhtml_not_115}^ Two
weeks of such iterations created Gehry's winning entry---after which the
process continued: try, learn, again.

Gehry has worked with models his whole career. His studio is filled with
them. In fact, he has a whole warehouse containing decades of models. He
starts at one scale. Then, to see the project from a different
perspective, he typically tries another and then another and so on. He
zeroes in on some aspect of the project in a model and pulls back to see
the whole in another, zooming in and out until he is satisfied that he
understands how the building will look and work from every viewpoint.
And always he is trying new ideas, discussing the results with his team
and with clients, deciding what works and what doesn't. And this is just
the beginning of his process.

After landing the contract to design the Guggenheim Bilbao, Gehry and
Chan spent the better part of two years working through iteration after
iteration, with the work moving from the decidedly analog world of
building blocks and cardboard to sophisticated
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_67 .pagebreak aria-label="67"
role="doc-pagebreak"}digital simulation using software called
CATIA.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_116){#chapter004.xhtml_not_116}^
Originally developed in 1977 by the French aerospace giant Dassault to
design jets, it was modified for Gehry to design buildings in all their
three-dimensional complexity. The level of detail and precision that
CATIA enables is astonishing. It has empowered Gehry's work and
imagination as has no other tool.

Earlier in his career, Gehry worked mostly with straight lines and
box-like shapes, but when his thoughts increasingly turned to curves, he
found that what he envisioned, once built, made him cringe. He showed me
a photo of one of his first buildings with curves, the Vitra Design
Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, completed in 1989. It's a beautiful
building, but the roof on the spiral staircase at the back of the
structure has a bump that doesn't seem
intentional.^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_117){#chapter004.xhtml_not_117}^
That's because it wasn't. Gehry could not make his two-dimensional
drawings work so that the builders could actually build what was in his
head. So they didn't---due to no fault of theirs. Gehry's vision was
simply not translating into the real world. But CATIA had been created
to work with curves as subtle as the lines of a jet's fuselage and
physics as unforgiving as aerodynamics beyond the speed of sound. For
the first time, Gehry and his team could experiment with the full
palette of shapes, confident about which could be built.

Three years after making that unwieldy roof in Germany, Gehry built the
Olympic Fish in Barcelona for the 1992 Summer Games. That was his first
design entirely done by CATIA and was made possible only by CATIA. The
curves now flowed. Only five years later, in 1997, the Guggenheim Museum
Bilbao opened. The transformation from the bump in Germany to the
elegant curves of Bilbao only eight years later is nothing less than
exceptional both technologically and aesthetically. It's as
radical---and happy---a transformation of architectural style as any in
architectural history.

CATIA's possibilities proved to be inexhaustible. Gehry and his team
could alter a curve here or change a shape there, and the
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_68 .pagebreak aria-label="68"
role="doc-pagebreak"}computer would quickly calculate the implications
for every other aspect of the building, from the structural integrity
(Will it stand?) to the functionality of the electrical and plumbing
systems (Will it work?) and the budget (Can we afford it?). Iteration
was now supercharged. Gehry took full advantage of the software's
capabilities, trying yet more ideas. In a real sense, the Guggenheim
building was first fully and successfully constructed on a computer.
Only after the completion of its "digital twin"---a term that would be
coined years after Gehry first created one---did construction begin in
the real world.

That approach enabled not only artistic daring but astonishing
efficiency, as Gehry and his team demonstrated when they later tackled 8
Spruce Street in New York City, a seventy-six-story apartment building.
Gehry had the brilliant idea of making the stainless steel facade bulge
and recede to resemble cloth rippling in the wind. But to do that, each
piece of the facade would be different, manufactured in a factory, then
assembled on-site. It all had to fit together seamlessly and do all the
practical work a facade must do, while creating the gorgeous illusion of
billowing cloth. And it couldn't cost much more than an ordinary facade.
To do that required relentless testing. "If you were to do this by hand,
you might get two or three tries within the allowable design period,"
noted Tensho Takemori, an architect at Gehry's
firm.^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_118){#chapter004.xhtml_not_118}^ But thanks
to the digital simulation, "We had thousands of iterations. And because
of that, we were actually able to hone the thing down to such great
efficiency that we could essentially reduce the cost to almost the same
as a flat curtain wall. The proof in this is there were no change
orders, and that's a pretty unheard-of result for a 76-story tower."

Years after the Guggenheim Bilbao made Gehry one of the world's most
celebrated architects, he made a guest appearance on an episode of *The
Simpsons:* Marge sends a letter to the renowned architect asking him to
design a concert hall for Springfield. Gehry crumples the letter and
throws it onto the ground, but then gasps when he sees its
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_69 .pagebreak aria-label="69"
role="doc-pagebreak"}shape. "Frank Gehry, you're a genius!" he shouts.
Cut to Gehry presenting a model of Springfield's new concert hall, which
looks remarkably like the Guggenheim
Bilbao.^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_119){#chapter004.xhtml_not_119}^ Gehry
came to regret the episode. He did it as a joke, but people took it
seriously. "It has haunted me," he explained to a TV interviewer.
"People who've seen *The Simpsons* believe
it."^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_120){#chapter004.xhtml_not_120}^ Frank Gehry
is indeed a genius, but everything else about that image of how he works
is wrong. In fact, it's the opposite of the truth.

The degree of care and precision that Gehry brought to the planning of
the Guggenheim Bilbao was, and is, highly unusual in the world of
architecture---and elsewhere. I've spoken with Gehry several times over
the years, in his studio, at Oxford where I invited him to lecture, and
on the road, and he is adamant that precise planning is essential. "In
our practice, we don't allow the client to start construction until we
are sure we are doing a building that's within their budget and meets
their requirements. We use all the technology available to us to
quantify in the most precise way the elements of the build so there's
not a lot of guessing," he told
me.^[18](#notes.xhtml#note_121){#chapter004.xhtml_not_121}^ Another time
he stated, "I want to guarantee that we can build that vision. And I
want to guarantee that we can build it at a price that the owner can
afford."^[19](#notes.xhtml#note_122){#chapter004.xhtml_not_122}^

It's hard to overstate the contrast between the planning of the
Guggenheim Bilbao and that of the Sydney Opera House. The former is the
perfect illustration of "Think slow, act fast"; that is, of how to do
projects. The latter is a painful example of "Think fast, act slow";
that is, how *not* to do projects. In that sense, this tale of two
masterpieces is about much more than architecture.

### [THE PIXAR WAY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Today, Pete Docter is the three-time Oscar-winning director of the
animated movies *Up, Inside Out,* and *Soul.* He is also the creative
director of Pixar, the renowned studio behind a long string of
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_70 .pagebreak aria-label="70"
role="doc-pagebreak"}eradefining movies, starting with the world's first
computer-animated feature, *Toy Story,* in 1995. But when Docter joined
Pixar in 1990, the studio was tiny. Digital animation was in its
infancy. And Docter was young and naive.

"I figured that people like Walt Disney would be like, lying in bed, and
suddenly shout 'Dumbo!'" he said and laughed. "The whole thing would be
in their head, and they could tell you the story from beginning to
end."^[20](#notes.xhtml#note_123){#chapter004.xhtml_not_123}^ With
experience, he discovered that the stories filmmakers tell do not come
so easily. "It starts as a gray blob," he said.

In a long conversation, Docter detailed the process Pixar uses to go
from "gray blob" to an Oscar-winning movie in theaters. I was prepared
for it to be quite different from what Gehry did to plan the Guggenheim
Bilbao. After all, an animated movie is as different from an art museum
as an opera house is from a wind farm. Yet in its fundamentals, the
process that Docter described bears a close resemblance to Gehry's
process.

It starts with time. Pixar gives its directors months to explore ideas
and develop a concept for a movie. At that point, it is a minimal idea,
no more than what a seed is to the tree it will become. "A French rat
loves to cook," for example. "A grouchy old man." Or "Inside the head of
a girl." Nothing more than that. "All I want is some catchy, intriguing
idea," Docter
said.^[21](#notes.xhtml#note_124){#chapter004.xhtml_not_124}^

The first, small step is an outline of roughly twelve pages explaining
how the idea can be the basis of a story. "It's mostly a description of
what happens. Where are we? What's going on? What happens in the
story?," said Docter. That is given to a group of Pixar
employees---directors, writers, artists, and executives. "People read it
and come back with criticisms, questions, concerns. And then typically
the person \[the director\] will go back and redo the outline again."
After which there may be another round of comments and redrafting.

Once "we can see where this is going," said Docter, the writing of
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_71 .pagebreak aria-label="71"
role="doc-pagebreak"}the script starts. The first draft will be around
120 pages, and it will go through the same process, likely with "a
couple of iterations." Docter emphasized that it is never mandatory for
the director to respond to feedback from anyone, at this stage or later.
"It's all just, hey, this is a free idea for you to use or not. The only
thing that is required is that it gets better."

That part of the process will be at least broadly familiar to anyone who
has written a script. But once there is a decent script in hand, Pixar
does something unusual: The director and a team of five to eight artists
turn the entire script into detailed storyboards that are photographed
and strung together into a video that roughly simulates the movie to
come. With each storyboard covering about two seconds of film time, a
ninety-minute movie requires approximately 2,700 drawings. Dialogue read
by employees is added, along with simple sound effects.

Now the whole movie exists in crude form. The process to that point
takes about three or four months. "So it's a fairly big investment,"
Docter told me. But it is still small compared with the cost of actual
production.

Next, Pixar employees, including many who have no other involvement in
the project, watch the video. "You can really feel when you have the
audience and when you don't. Without anybody saying anything," noted
Docter. "A lot of times, I already know the stuff I want to change." The
director also meets with a small group of other Pixar filmmakers, called
the "brain trust," who critique the film. "They'll say, 'I didn't
understand something, I wasn't on board with your main character, you
had me but then you confused me.' Whatever. It's a wide range of
different things that get picked on."

Invariably, after that first screening, "a significant percentage of the
film gets chucked," said Docter. The script is substantially rewritten.
New storyboards are drawn and photographed and edited together, new
voices are recorded, and sound effects are added. This second
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_72 .pagebreak aria-label="72"
role="doc-pagebreak"}iteration of the movie is shown to an audience,
including the brain trust, and the director gets new feedback.

Repeat.

Then do it again. And again. And again.

A Pixar movie usually goes through the cycle from script to audience
feedback *eight times.* The amount of change between versions one and
two "is usually huge," said Docter. "Two to three is pretty big. And
then, hopefully, as time goes on, there are enough elements that work
that the changes become smaller and smaller."

In the version of Docter's Oscar-winning *Inside Out* released to
theaters, the story is set mostly inside the mind of a girl, with
characters named Joy, Sadness, Anger, and others representing the
emotions the girl experiences. But in the early versions of the movie,
the cast was much larger, with characters representing the full array of
emotions that Docter had learned about in discussions with psychologists
and neuroscientists. Even Schadenfreude and Ennui were part of the cast.
And the characters were given normal, human names. The audience was
expected to know which emotion the character represented by the
character's behavior. It didn't work. "That proved to be very confusing
for people," Docter said with a laugh. So he threw out several
characters and simplified the names of the rest. That was major surgery.
But it worked.

In a later round, when Docter was working at a much more granular level,
the script had Joy lost in the deeper regions of the brain, far from its
control room, where decisions are made, and she says something like "I
have to get back to the control room!" several times. The lines were
important. They told the audience what the goal was and underscored its
urgency. But the feedback told Docter that they made Joy sound
self-important and therefore unlikable. Docter's solution? Give those
lines to other characters. "So Sadness will say, 'Joy, you've got to get
up there!'" That's a tiny tweak, "but it ends up having a fairly
significant effect on how you feel about that character."

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_73 .pagebreak aria-label="73"
role="doc-pagebreak"}After eight rounds or so of this exhaustive and
exhausting process, the director has an extremely detailed and
rigorously tested proof of concept. The movie has been simulated much as
Gehry simulates his buildings with physical models and on CATIA. Then
real animation begins, using Pixar's state-of-the-art computers. Scenes
are created one frame at a time. Famous actors do voice-overs. A
professional score is recorded. Sound effects are created. All the
elements are pulled together, and the actual movie that will fill
theaters and be seen on televisions the world over is finally created.
"By the time you see the film," Docter said, "it's about the ninth
version of the movie that we've put up."

### [WHY ITERATION WORKS]{.sans} {.author-head1}

This process involves "an insane amount of work," Docter acknowledged.
But a highly iterative process such as Pixar's is worth the
extraordinary work it entails, for four reasons.

First, iteration frees people to experiment, as Edison did with such
success. "I need the freedom to just try a bunch of crap out. And a lot
of times it doesn't work," Docter told me. With this process, that's
fine. He can try again. And again. Until he gets something that burns
bright and clear, like Edison's lightbulb. "If I knew I have to do this
only once and get it right, I'd probably hew to the things that I know
work." And for a studio built on creativity, that would be a slow death.

Second, the process ensures that literally every part of the plan, from
the broad strokes to the fine details, is scrutinized and tested.
Nothing is left to be figured out when the project goes into delivery.
This is a basic difference between good and bad planning. In bad
planning, it is routine to leave problems, challenges, and unknowns to
be figured out later. That's how the Sydney Opera House got into
trouble. In that case, Jørn Utzon did eventually solve the problem, but
it was too late. The budget had exploded, construction was years
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_74 .pagebreak aria-label="74"
role="doc-pagebreak"}behind schedule, and Utzon was ousted with his
reputation in tatters. In many projects, the problem is *never* solved.

Such failure is so common in Silicon Valley that there is even a name
for it. "Vaporware" is software that is publicly touted but never
released because developers can't figure out how to make the hype real.
Vaporware typically isn't fraud, or at least it doesn't start that way,
as there is often honest optimism at work and every intention of
delivering. But past a certain point, it can become fraud. *The Wall
Street Journal* reporter and author John Carreyrou believes that exactly
this dynamic lay behind one of the worst scandals in Silicon Valley
history. Theranos, a company founded by its charismatic
nineteen-year-old CEO, Elizabeth Holmes---with former secretaries of
state George Shultz and Henry Kissinger as board members---raised \$1.3
billion from investors after it claimed to have developed a spectacular
new blood-testing
technology.^[22](#notes.xhtml#note_125){#chapter004.xhtml_not_125}^ It
was a mirage, and Theranos collapsed amid a hailstorm of fraud charges
and lawsuits.^[23](#notes.xhtml#note_126){#chapter004.xhtml_not_126}^

Third, an iterative process such as Pixar's corrects for a basic
cognitive bias that psychologists call the "illusion of explanatory
depth."

Do you know how a bicycle works? Most people are sure they do, yet they
are unable to complete a simple line drawing that shows how a bicycle
works. Even when much of the bicycle is already drawn for them, they
can't do it. "People feel they understand complex phenomena with far
greater precision, coherence, and depth than they really do,"
researchers concluded. For planners, the illusion of explanatory depth
is obviously dangerous. But researchers also discovered that, unlike
many other biases, there is a relatively easy fix: When people try and
fail to explain what they mistakenly think they understand, the illusion
dissolves. By requiring Pixar film directors to walk through every step
from the big to the small and show exactly what they will do, Pixar's
process forces them to explain. Illusions evaporate long before
production begins, which is when they would become dangerous and
expensive.^[24](#notes.xhtml#note_127){#chapter004.xhtml_not_127}^

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_75 .pagebreak aria-label="75"
role="doc-pagebreak"}That brings us to the fourth reason why iterative
processes work, which I touched on in chapter 1: Planning is cheap. Not
in absolute terms, perhaps. The rough videos Pixar produces require a
director leading a small team of writers and artists. Keeping them all
working for years is a significant cost. But compared to the cost of
producing digital animation ready for theaters, which requires hundreds
of highly skilled people using the most advanced technology in the
world, movie stars doing voices, and leading composers creating the
score, it is so minor that even making experimental videos over and over
again is relatively inexpensive.

That cost difference is important for the simple reason that in a big
project problems are inevitable. The only question is, When will they
arise? An iterative process greatly increases the probability that the
answer to that question is "in planning." That can make all the
difference. If a serious problem is discovered in version five of a
Pixar movie and whole scenes need to be thrown out and redone, the
amount of time and money lost is relatively modest. If the same problem
is discovered when the movie is in production and whole scenes need to
be thrown out and redone, it could be horrendously expensive, create
dangerous delays, and possibly sink the whole project.

This simple distinction applies in most fields: Whatever can be done in
planning should be, and planning should be slow and rigorously
iterative, based on *experiri.* Of course, there's more to Pixar's
record of success than its remarkable development process, but there is
no question that that process is a major contributor to a success record
unlike any other in Hollywood history. Pixar hasn't only delivered
movies that won critical praise, reaped box-office fortunes, and became
cultural touchstones, it has done so with unprecedented consistency.
When Pixar released *Toy Story,* its first feature film, in 1995, it was
a little-known upstart. A decade later, Disney, the behemoth of
entertainment, paid \$9.7 billion in 2021 dollars to buy the company.
More tellingly, Disney asked Ed Catmull, then the CEO of Pixar, to
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_76 .pagebreak aria-label="76"
role="doc-pagebreak"}take control of both Pixar and Disney Animation,
the legendary studio that had long been struggling.

It was a smart move. Catmull turned Disney Animation around while
continuing Pixar's string of successes. Catmull is now retired from
Pixar and Disney; under his leadership, Pixar successfully delivered
twenty-one out of twenty-two projects he started, while Disney delivered
ten out of eleven. No other studio in Hollywood's more than
one-hundred-year history has had a similar success rate.

That is a process that works.

### [TESTING, TESTING]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Anyone familiar with how Silicon Valley operates has probably been
nursing an objection from the first chapter of this book. The United
States' capital of information technology is arguably the most
successful and influential business hub in history, and its
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists quite explicitly do not slowly and
meticulously plan their projects. In fact, they often scorn the words
*plan* and *planning*.

In Silicon Valley, the standard approach for startups is to release a
product quickly, even if it is far from perfect, then continue
developing the product in response to consumer feedback. This is the
"lean startup" model made famous by the entrepreneur Eric Ries in his
2011 book of the same
name.^[25](#notes.xhtml#note_128){#chapter004.xhtml_not_128}^ It sounds
an awful lot like the rush to get projects under way before they have
been slowly and carefully planned---the very thing I have condemned as a
key cause of project failure from the first page of this book. The
success of Silicon Valley would seem to be a rebuke to my whole
approach.

In fact, the lean startup model squares well with my advice. The
contradiction arises only if you take a narrow view of the nature of
planning.

Planning, as I see it, is not merely sitting and thinking, much less a
rule-based bureaucratic exercise of programming. It is an *active*
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_77 .pagebreak aria-label="77"
role="doc-pagebreak"}process. Planning is *doing:* Try something, see if
it works, and try something else in light of what you've learned.
Planning is iteration and learning before you deliver at full scale,
with careful, demanding, extensive testing producing a plan that
increases the odds of the delivery going smoothly and swiftly.

It's what Frank Gehry did for the Guggenheim Bilbao and has done for all
his projects since. It's what Pixar does to make each of its landmark
movies. It's what fast-growing wind and solar farms do in a global
attempt to outcompete fossil fuels, as we will see later. And it's the
core of the lean startup model.

Ries wrote that startups operate in an environment of "extreme
uncertainty" in which it is impossible to know whether the product they
have developed is one that consumers will value. "We must learn what
customers really want," he advised, "not what they say they want or what
we think they should want." The only way to do that is to "experiment."
Create a "minimum viable product," put it in front of consumers, and see
what happens. With lessons learned, change the product, ship again, and
repeat the cycle.

Ries called this the building phase, as multiple iterations gradually
build the final product. I would call it the planning phase, as the
design of the product evolves following the dictum "Try, learn, again."
Semantics aside, the only real difference is the method of testing.

If there were no other considerations involved, such as money, safety,
and time, the ideal testing method would be to simply do whatever it is
you are thinking of doing in the real world with real people, and see
what happens. That's what NASA effectively did with Project Apollo, as
it conducted individual missions to test each of the steps that would be
required to get to the moon and back: getting into orbit, maneuvering to
another spacecraft, docking. Only when NASA had mastered a step did it
go on to the next one. And only when it had mastered as many of the
steps as it could test did it send Apollo 11 to the moon. But this sort
of testing is almost never possible for []{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_78
.pagebreak aria-label="78" role="doc-pagebreak"}big projects because it
is too expensive. Project Apollo cost roughly \$180 billion in 2021
dollars.^[26](#notes.xhtml#note_129){#chapter004.xhtml_not_129}^ Worse,
it can be dangerous. The astronauts in Project Apollo all knowingly
risked their lives. Three died.

The "minimum viable product" model comes close to the impossible ideal
by doing enough testing to bring the product up to the "minimum viable"
standard before releasing it into the real world to get that valuable
feedback. But it can be done with only a limited range of projects. You
can't build a skyscraper, see how people like it, then knock it down and
build another. Nor can you put a passenger jet into service to see if it
crashes.

As John Carreyrou observed, one reason Theranos got into trouble was
that it used a Silicon Valley model commonly applied to software, which
can afford to have initial glitches and failures, for medical testing,
which cannot. Even for software-based companies, the lean startup model
can easily be taken too far, as when glitches cause reputation-damaging
product failures, security risks, breaches of privacy, and scandals such
as Cambridge Analytica's use of personal data. Or when Instagram is
harmful to teenage girls' self-image. Or when Facebook and Twitter
arguably contributed to the 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Here a motto
like Facebook's "Move fast and break things" seems downright
irresponsible. Users and policy makers understandably push back and
insist that Silicon Valley figure out what's wrong with its products and
fix them before releasing them into the real world.

### [MAXIMUM VIRTUAL PRODUCT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

When a minimum viable product approach isn't possible, try a "maximum
virtual product"---a hyperrealistic, exquisitely detailed model like
those that Frank Gehry made for the Guggenheim Bilbao and all his
buildings since and those that Pixar makes for each of its feature films
before shooting.

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_Page_79 .pagebreak aria-label="79"
role="doc-pagebreak"}However, the creation of a maximum virtual product
requires access to the necessary technology. If that's not available,
look to less sophisticated tools, even technology at the opposite end of
the spectrum of sophistication. Remember that Gehry developed the basic
design of the Guggenheim Bilbao, and so many other renowned buildings,
using sketches, wooden blocks, and cardboard models---technologies
available in the average kindergarten classroom. Pixar's mock-up videos
may use more advanced tech than that, but photographing drawings,
recording voices, and combining them into a crude video is something a
twelve-year-old can---and does---do with an iPhone.

The fact is that a wide array of projects---events, products, books,
home renovations, you name it---can be simulated, tested, and iterated
even by amateurs at home. Lack of technology isn't the real barrier to
adopting this approach; the barrier is thinking of planning as a static,
abstract, bureaucratic exercise. Once you make the conceptual shift to
planning as an active, iterative process of trying, learning, and trying
again, all sorts of ways to "play" with ideas, as Gehry and Pixar do,
will suggest themselves.

This is why Pete Docter is clear-eyed and humble about Pixar planning.
Pixar puts more than \$100 million on the line with each project. It has
world-class employees and dazzling technology. But at its core, Docter
said, Pixar's planning process is no different than if you were
designing a carrot peeler in your basement. "You have an idea, you make
something with it, you give it to a friend to try. The friend cuts
himself. 'Okay, give it back. I'm going to change it. Here, try again.'
And it's
better!"^[27](#notes.xhtml#note_130){#chapter004.xhtml_not_130}^

Try, learn, again. Whatever the project or the technology, it's the most
effective path to a plan that delivers.

## ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? {.chapter-title}

::: ext2
*Experience is invaluable. But too often it is overlooked or dismissed
for other considerations. Or it is simply misunderstood and
marginalized. Here's how to avoid that.*
:::

There is one small fact I didn't mention when contrasting the planning
and construction of the Sydney Opera House and the Guggenheim Museum
Bilbao: Jørn Utzon (born 1918) was thirty-eight years old when he won
the competition to construct his visionary building while Frank Gehry
(born 1929) was sixty-two when he won his.

In another context, that age discrepancy would be trivial. In this case,
it's paramount. Age reflects time, and time enables experience. The gap
in age of the two visionary architects when they undertook the works
that would shape their lives and legacies tells us that there was a big
gap in their experience.

And the age gap actually understates the experience gap. Utzon was
Danish and graduated from architecture school during the Second World
War, when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. There was little work to
be had during and after the war, so Utzon had done nothing notable
before he started designing the Sydney Opera House. Gehry, in contrast,
had spent his early career in booming postwar Los Angeles, where he took
on a long list of small but increasingly ambitious projects. By the time
he tackled the Guggenheim Bilbao, he had more experience than most
architects do the day they retire. The experience gap---or rather, the
experience canyon---[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_81 .pagebreak
aria-label="81" role="doc-pagebreak"}between the two architects is
another major reason why the creation of the Sydney Opera House was a
fiasco while that of the Guggenheim Bilbao remains a model to follow.

We all know that experience is valuable. All else being equal, an
experienced carpenter is a better carpenter than an inexperienced one.
It should also be obvious that in the planning and delivery of big
projects experience should be maximized whenever possible---by hiring
the experienced carpenter, for example. It shouldn't be necessary to say
that.

But it *is* necessary to say it---loudly and insistently---because, as
we shall see, big projects routinely do *not* make maximum use of
experience. In fact, experience is often aggressively marginalized. This
happens when priority is given to other considerations. One big one is
politics. The ambition to be the first, the biggest, the tallest, or
some other superlative is another.

More fundamentally, we do not make the most of experience because we do
not appreciate how deeply experience can enrich judgment and improve
project planning and leadership. Aristotle said that experience is "the
fruit of years" and argued that it is the source of what he called
"*phronesis*"---the "practical wisdom" that allows us to see what is
good for people and to make it happen, which Aristotle saw as the
highest "intellectual
virtue."^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_131){#chapter005.xhtml_not_131}^ Modern
science suggests that he was quite right.

We should make more use of this ancient insight.

### [MARGINALIZING EXPERIENCE]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Back in chapter 1, I mentioned the story of my father
grumbling---presciently, as it turned out---about the Danish government
awarding a contract to an inexperienced contractor to drill an undersea
tunnel. Not coincidentally, the company was led by Danes. Politicians
everywhere know that awarding contracts to domestic
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_82 .pagebreak aria-label="82"
role="doc-pagebreak"}companies is a good way to make influential friends
and win public support with promises of jobs, even if the domestic
company will not perform as well as its foreign competitor because it is
less experienced. When this happens---and it happens routinely---those
responsible put other interests ahead of achieving the project's goal.
At a minimum, such an approach is economically dubious, and sometimes it
is ethically dodgy, too, or downright dangerous. And elected officials
are far from alone in doing this. Big projects involve big money and big
self-interest. And since "who gets what" is the core of politics, there
is politics in every big project, whether public or private.

This fact helps explain why the California High-Speed Rail project
became such a mess. There is no real high-speed rail in the United
States, which suggests how much experience US companies have building
it. When California started to seriously consider this type of rail,
foreign companies with lots of experience---notably SNCF, the French
National Railway Company---set up offices in California in the hope of
landing a sole-source contract or at least being a major partner in the
project's development. But the state decided not to go that way.
Instead, it hired a large number of mostly inexperienced, mostly US
contractors and oversaw them with managers who also had little or no
experience with high-speed
rail.^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_132){#chapter005.xhtml_not_132}^ That's a
terrible way to run a project. But it's common---because it's good
politics.

A Canadian example is arguably even more egregious. When the Canadian
government decided it wanted to buy two icebreakers, it didn't buy them
from manufacturers in other countries that were more experienced with
building icebreakers, deciding instead to give the contracts to Canadian
companies. That's national politics. But rather than give the contracts
to one company so that it could build one ship, learn from the
experience, and deliver the second ship more efficiently, it gave one
contract to one company and the other to another company. Splitting the
contract "will not lead to these natural []{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_83
.pagebreak aria-label="83" role="doc-pagebreak"}learning improvements,"
noted a report by the parliamentary budget officer, Yves Giroux---a
report that found that the estimated cost of the icebreakers had soared
from \$2.6 billion (Canadian) to \$7.25 billion. So why do it? One
company is in a politically important region in Quebec, the other in a
politically important region in British Columbia. Splitting the
contracts meant twice the political payoff---at the cost of experience
and billions of
dollars.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_133){#chapter005.xhtml_not_133}^

### [BEING FIRST]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The ambition to be the first with something is another way experience
gets sidelined. I personally saw how misplaced this ambition can be two
decades ago. The Danish Court Administration, the body that governs city
courts, regional courts, and the supreme court in Denmark, was
considering the creation of two big new IT systems, one of which would
digitize all real estate records in the country and another that would
make the administration of the courts entirely digital, including all
legal documents. I was a member of the board of directors of the courts
making the
decision.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_134){#chapter005.xhtml_not_134}^ At the
time, I had been studying big projects for about a decade, and although
I hadn't yet studied IT, the plan made me nervous. We didn't know of
anyone who had done something like what we were planning. And if my
studies had shown anything, it was that going first is dangerous. So I
suggested that a team from the Court Administration visit other
countries to investigate. If we found that others had done such a thing
already, we could learn from them. If we didn't, we could wait.

Except that wasn't what happened. The team duly traveled to various
countries and reported back in a board meeting. Had anyone else done
this? "No!" was the excited reply. "We will be the first in the world!"
I had mistakenly thought that my fellow board members would see being
first as a strong argument *against* going ahead. In fact, they took it
as a reason to charge onward. The desire to do what
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_84 .pagebreak aria-label="84"
role="doc-pagebreak"}has never been done before can be admirable, for
sure. But it can also be deeply problematic.

These two very expensive IT projects were authorized, and they quickly
turned into epic fiascos. Deadlines were repeatedly pushed back and
budgets badly overrun. When completed, the new systems were buggy and
worked badly. They became a political scandal that made the front pages
of newspapers over and over for years. Several staff had nervous
breakdowns and went on sick leave.

The only upside to the misery was that those who went second, third, and
fourth could study our experience and do better. But did they? Probably
not. Similar large-scale IT projects continue to be deeply troubled.
Planners don't value experience to the extent they should because they
commonly suffer yet another behavioral bias, "uniqueness bias," which
means they tend to see their projects as unique, one-off ventures that
have little or nothing to learn from earlier
projects.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_135){#chapter005.xhtml_not_135}^ And so
they commonly don't.

These examples are from the public sector. Those in the private sector
may object that, yes, experience is good and there is no upside to being
the first court system to digitize its records. But a company that
develops the first-ever widget and is first to bring it to market does
have an upside, the famous "first-mover
advantage."^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_136){#chapter005.xhtml_not_136}^
Surely this advantage more than compensates for the downside of not
being able to learn from the experience of others.

But the first-mover advantage is greatly overstated. In a watershed
study, researchers compared the fates of "pioneer" companies that had
been the first to exploit a market and "settlers" that had followed the
pioneers into the market. Drawing on data from five hundred brands in
fifty product categories, they found that almost half of pioneers
failed, compared to 8 percent of settlers. The surviving pioneers took
10 percent of their market, on average, compared to 28 percent for
settlers. Getting into the market early was indeed important---"early
market leaders have much greater long-term success," the researchers
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_85 .pagebreak aria-label="85"
role="doc-pagebreak"}noted---but those "early" market leaders "enter an
average of 13 years after
pioneers."^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_137){#chapter005.xhtml_not_137}^ The
consensus of researchers today is that, yes, being first to market can
confer advantages in certain specific circumstances, but it comes at the
terrible cost of an inability to learn from the experience of others.
Better to be---like Apple following Blackberry into smartphones---a
"fast follower" and learn from the first
mover.^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_138){#chapter005.xhtml_not_138}^

### [BIGGEST, TALLEST, LONGEST, FASTEST]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Ambition not only urges us to be first, it can also drive us to deliver
the biggest. The tallest. The longest. The fastest. This quest for other
superlatives can be as dangerous as the desire to be first, and for the
same reason.

Consider Seattle's State Route 99 tunnel. A decade ago, when Seattle
announced that it would bore a tunnel under its waterfront to replace a
highway on the surface, it was far from a first, so there was plenty of
relevant experience to draw on. But Seattle decided that its tunnel
would be the biggest of its kind in the world, with enough room for two
decks, each with two lanes of traffic. Politicians boasted. "Biggest" is
at least as exciting as "first." It gets you into the news, something
most politicians find useful.

But to bore the world's biggest tunnel, you need the world's biggest
boring machine. Such a machine, by definition, hasn't been built and
used before. It would be the first. Seattle placed a custom order and
the machine was duly designed, built, and delivered. That cost \$80
million, which is more than double the price of a standard boring
machine. After boring a thousand feet of a tunnel that would be nine
thousand feet long, the borer broke down and became the world's biggest
cork in a bottle. Extracting it from the tunnel, repairing it, and
getting it back to work took two years and cost another \$143 million.
Seattle's new underground highway, needless to say, was completed late
and over budget, with pending litigation making
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_86 .pagebreak aria-label="86"
role="doc-pagebreak"}further overruns likely. If the city had instead
chosen to drill two standard-sized tunnels, it could have used
off-the-shelf drilling equipment that had already been widely used and
was therefore more reliable, and they could have hired teams experienced
at running these machines. But politicians wouldn't have been able to
brag about the size of the tunnel.

Along with the usual political concerns, one reason why mistakes such as
Seattle's happen is that we too often think that only people can be
experienced, not things, and that therefore using new technology is not
like hiring an inexperienced carpenter. That's a mistake---because it
is.

Remember Pixar's Pete Docter explaining the design of a new carrot
peeler at the end of the previous chapter? He makes one. A friend tries
it and cuts himself. So he alters the design, and the friend tries
again. In this way, the iterative process of trying and learning
steadily improves the peeler's design. The carrot peeler embodies the
experience that created it, and Docter wants a peeler that incorporates
the best experience, just as his movies at Pixar do.

This doesn't end when the formal design process ends, either. If
Docter's carrot peeler were to become a hit, sell millions, and be used
by generations of cooks and the design was never changed because it
worked so beautifully, all that subsequent experience could be said to
be embodied in the object as its validation. That's reliable technology.

### [FROZEN EXPERIENCE]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The German philosopher Friedrich von Schelling called architecture
"frozen music."^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_139){#chapter005.xhtml_not_139}^
It's a lovely and memorable phrase, so I'm going to adapt it: Technology
is "frozen experience."

If we see technology this way, it is clear that, other things being
equal, project planners should prefer highly experienced technology for
the same reason house builders should prefer highly experienced
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_87 .pagebreak aria-label="87"
role="doc-pagebreak"}carpenters. But we often don't see technology this
way. Too often, we assume that newer is better. Or worse, we assume the
same of something that is custom designed, which we praise as
"unique,""bespoke," or "original." If decision makers valued experience
properly, they would be wary of a technology that is new, because it is
*inexperienced* technology. And anything that is truly "one of a kind"
would set off alarm bells. But all too often, "new" or "unique" is
treated as a selling point, not something to avoid. This is a big
mistake. Planners and decision makers make it all the time. It's a main
reason that projects underperform.

### [OLYMPIC BLOWOUTS]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Combine all the wrongheadedness described in the preceding passages, and
you get the Olympics.

Since 1960, the total cost of hosting the Games---six weeks of
competitions, including the Paralympics, held once every four
years---has grown spectacularly and is now in the tens of billions of
dollars. Every Olympic Games since 1960 for which data are available,
summer and winter, has gone over budget. The average overrun is 157
percent in real terms. Only nuclear waste storage has higher cost
overruns of the twenty-plus project categories my team and I study.
Scarier still, the overruns follow a power-law distribution, meaning
that really extreme overruns are surprisingly common. The current holder
of the one Olympic record no one wants---in cost overrun---is Montreal,
which went 720 percent over budget in 1976. But thanks to the power law,
it is likely only a matter of time before some unlucky city becomes the
new Olympic
champion.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_140){#chapter005.xhtml_not_140}^

There are many reasons for the sorry record of the Olympics, but much of
the explanation lies in the way the Games aggressively marginalize
experience.

There is no permanent host for the Games. Instead, the
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_88 .pagebreak aria-label="88"
role="doc-pagebreak"}International Olympic Committee (IOC) calls on
cities to bid for each Games. The IOC prefers to move the Games from
region to region, continent to continent, because that's an excellent
way to promote the Olympic brand and therefore serves the interests of
the IOC---which is to say, it is excellent politics. But it also means
that when a city and a country win the right to host the Games, it is
likely that neither the city nor the country has any experience in doing
so. Or if it has hosted the Olympics before, it was so long in the past
that the people who did the work are retired or dead. London, for
example, has hosted the Olympics twice---with sixty-four years between
events. Tokyo hosted twice, with fifty-seven years between events. Los
Angeles will host twice, with forty-four years between events. One
solution would be for Olympic host cities to hire the people and
companies that did the work four and eight years earlier, and that
happens to an extent. But politics would never allow that to prevail.
The bill for hosting the Olympics is massive. Only by promising
lucrative contracts and jobs to locals can governments win support for a
bid. And whether locals or professional Olympic nomads do the job, the
host will have no experience in leading such a workforce, for the
reasons mentioned above.

As a result, even if the Games repeat every four years, hosting
performance is not driven up a positive learning curve by experience.
The Olympics are forever planned and delivered by beginners---a
crippling deficiency I call "Eternal Beginner
Syndrome."^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_141){#chapter005.xhtml_not_141}^

On top of this come pride and the quest for gold. The Olympic motto is
"Faster, higher, stronger," and host cities aspire to their own
superlatives in constructing facilities. Rather than using existing
designs or repeating designs shown to work by experience elsewhere, they
routinely seek to build the first, the biggest, the tallest, the most
unusual, the most beautiful, the unique, experience be damned. These
pathologies can be seen in the Olympic record holder for cost overrun,
the Montreal Games of 1976. "All the structures were dramatic,
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_89 .pagebreak aria-label="89"
role="doc-pagebreak"}modern, and complex," noted a 2013 case study
written by engineers, "none more so than the main
stadium."^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_142){#chapter005.xhtml_not_142}^

The architect of the stadium was Roger Taillibert, a personal favorite
of Mayor Jean Drapeau, who envisioned a clamshell with a hole in the
roof over which a tall, curved tower would lean dramatically. Tension
cables would connect the tower to the stadium, allowing a retractable
roof to be raised or lowered over the hole. Nothing like it had been
done before, which was what seemed to most delight Drapeau and
Taillibert, but which should have triggered alarm bells.

Taillibert's plans showed little regard for mere practicalities. "The
stadium design did not consider constructability and did not leave room
for interior scaffolding," the reviewing engineers wrote, leaving
workers with no choice but to build the stadium by clustering scores of
cranes so tightly together that they interfered with one
another.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_143){#chapter005.xhtml_not_143}^

With costs exploding and construction far behind schedule, the
government of Quebec ousted Drapeau and Taillibert, sprayed a fire hose
of money, and barely managed to start the Games on schedule. There was
no roof on the stadium, and the tower that was supposed to be the
dramatic centerpiece was still only an ugly
stub.^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_144){#chapter005.xhtml_not_144}^

After the Games, costs kept escalating as engineers realized that the
tower could not be built as Taillibert had planned. An alternative
design was developed, and the roof was finally installed a decade later.
A litany of mishaps, malfunctions, repairs, replacements, and more cost
increases followed. When Roger Taillibert died in 2019, the obituary in
the *Montreal Gazette* opened by noting that the Olympic stadium had
cost so much that "it took 30 years" for Quebec to pay it off. "And more
than four decades later, it is still plagued by a roof that does not
work."^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_145){#chapter005.xhtml_not_145}^

In the years leading up to the Games, the stadium's shape had inspired
the nickname "the Big O," but that quickly morphed into "the Big Owe."
In that sense, Montreal's Olympic Stadium should be considered the
unofficial mascot of the modern Olympic Games. But
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_90 .pagebreak aria-label="90"
role="doc-pagebreak"}it's not alone. Search online for "abandoned
Olympic venues," and you will find many more, and worse, monuments to
Olympic folly.

### [MAXING OUT ON EXPERIENCE]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The polar opposite of the Big Owe is the Empire State Building.

As I described at the beginning of this book, the legendary building was
completed at astonishing speed, in large part due to architect William
Lamb's focus on developing a carefully tested plan that would empower a
smooth, swift delivery. But another factor was his insistence that the
project use existing, proven technologies "in order to avoid the
uncertainty of innovative
methods."^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_146){#chapter005.xhtml_not_146}^ That
included avoiding "hand work" whenever possible and replacing it with
parts designed "so that they could be duplicated in tremendous quantity
with almost perfect accuracy," Lamb wrote, "and brought to the building
and put together like an automobile on the assembly
line."^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_147){#chapter005.xhtml_not_147}^ Lamb
minimized variety and complexity, including in floor designs, which were
kept similar as much as possible. As a result, construction crews could
learn by repeating. In other words, workers didn't build one 102-story
building, they built 102 one-story buildings. The whole project shot up
the learning curve, and the quick pace of construction only
accelerated.^[18](#notes.xhtml#note_148){#chapter005.xhtml_not_148}^

Still, the plan might have failed to deliver if it had been handed to
neophytes. But the general contractors who erected the giant were
Starrett Brothers and Eken, "a company with a proven track record of
efficiency and speed in skyscraper construction," noted the historian
Carol Willis.^[19](#notes.xhtml#note_149){#chapter005.xhtml_not_149}^

It also helped that it wasn't the first time Lamb had designed the
building. In Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the Reynolds Building, once
the headquarters of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, is an elegant
art deco structure that looks remarkably like a smaller, shorter Empire
State Building. Lamb designed it in 1927, and it opened in
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_91 .pagebreak aria-label="91"
role="doc-pagebreak"}1929, the year before construction began on the
Empire State Building, taking that year's National Architectural
Association's Building of the Year
Award.^[20](#notes.xhtml#note_150){#chapter005.xhtml_not_150}^ In
designing and erecting the Empire State Building, Lamb was informed by
the best experience an architect can hope for: enhancing a prior
success.

Is the Empire State Building diminished by the fact that core elements
of its design were used in an earlier project? Or that the design is
deliberately simple and repetitive? I don't see how one could make that
case. The building is iconic. It even achieved one of those superlatives
people so desire---"world's tallest"---without taking undue risks.

Anyone with a big project in mind should hope to have an equivalent
success. Maximizing experience is an excellent way to boost the chances
of that.

### [WE KNOW MORE THAN WE CAN TELL]{.sans} {.author-head1}

But as important as "frozen experience" is to getting projects right, we
also need to look at the "unfrozen" kind---the lived experience of
people. That's because experience is what elevates the best project
leaders---people like Frank Gehry and Pete Docter---above the rest. And
in both planning and delivery, there is no better asset for a big
project than an experienced leader with an experienced team.

How does experience make people better at their jobs? Ask someone that
question, and you'll likely hear that with experience people know more.
That's true as far as it goes. People who work with a tool learn how to
use it, so they gain knowledge such as "The safety lock must be turned
off before the tool can start."

You don't actually need experience to get that sort of knowledge.
Someone can just tell you, or you can find it in a manual; it is
"explicit knowledge." But as the scientist and philosopher Michael
Polanyi showed, much of the most valuable knowledge we can possess and
use isn't like that; it is "tacit knowledge." We *feel* tacit knowledge.
And []{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_92 .pagebreak aria-label="92"
role="doc-pagebreak"}when we try to put it into words, the words never
fully capture it. As Polanyi wrote, "We can know more than we can
tell."^[21](#notes.xhtml#note_151){#chapter005.xhtml_not_151}^

When an adult gives a child what she thinks are complete instructions on
how to ride a bike ("Put your foot on the pedal, push off, press down on
the other pedal"), the child typically falls on her first tries, because
the instructions are *not* complete. And they cannot be. Much of what
the adult knows about how to ride a bike (for example, how exactly to
maintain balance during a turn at a certain speed) is knowledge that she
feels. It can't be put fully into words, no matter how many words she
uses. So although the instructions are helpful, the only way for the
child to learn how to ride a bike is to try, fail, and try again. That
is, she needs to develop experience and get that tacit knowledge for
herself.

This is obvious in the case of physical activities such as riding a
bicycle or playing golf, but it applies to so much more. Polanyi
actually developed the concept of tacit knowledge in an exploration of
how scientists do science.

Highly experienced project leaders like Frank Gehry and Pete Docter
overflow with tacit knowledge about the many facets of the big projects
they oversee. It improves their judgment profoundly. Often, they will
*feel* that something is wrong or that there is a better way without
quite being able to say why. As a large research literature shows, the
intuitions of such experts are, under the right conditions, highly
reliable. They can even be astonishingly accurate, as in the famous
story of the art experts who instantly felt, correctly, that a
supposedly ancient Greek statue was a fraud, even though it had passed
various scientific tests and even if they couldn't say why they felt the
way they did.^[22](#notes.xhtml#note_152){#chapter005.xhtml_not_152}^
This is "skilled intuition," not garden-variety gut feelings, which are
unreliable. It is a powerful tool available only to genuine
experts---that is, people with long experience working in their domain
of expertise.^[23](#notes.xhtml#note_153){#chapter005.xhtml_not_153}^

When a highly experienced project leader uses a highly iterative
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_93 .pagebreak aria-label="93"
role="doc-pagebreak"}planning process---what I earlier called "Pixar
planning"---good things happen. When writing scripts or dreaming up
images, Pete Docter said, "I just dive in and do stuff completely
intuitively. I'm going to be more accurate. I'm funnier. More truthful."
But Docter then puts his intuitive judgments to the test by turning his
scripts and images into a video mock-up and seeing how an audience
responds. He analyzes what's working and what isn't and adjusts
accordingly. By shifting from one mode to the other, over and over
again, he gets the most from both intuition and careful thought.

But the value of judgment enriched by experience is not limited to
planning. When Jørn Utzon won the competition to design the Sydney Opera
House, he entered a complex, difficult political environment, far from
his home turf, where an array of powerful figures were pressing their
own interests and agendas. Lacking relevant experience in navigating
this environment, he was a babe in the woods. And the wolves got him.

Frank Gehry's climb up the ladder of experience, in contrast, gave him
an escalating education in the politics of big projects. His toughest
lessons came in his biggest commission before the Guggenheim Bilbao: the
Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Like the Sydney Opera House, it
was conceived in a difficult political environment with powerful people
and clashing views that resulted in conflicts, a rushed start, and a
project that dragged on and on, getting deeper and deeper into cost
overruns.^[24](#notes.xhtml#note_154){#chapter005.xhtml_not_154}^ Like
Utzon's, Gehry's reputation suffered. He might ultimately have shared
Utzon's fate if not for the intervention of supporters, notably the
Disney family, whose original gift of \$50 million had gotten the
project started and who made it a condition of their continued support
that Gehry remain the architect when his detractors tried to oust him
from the project. When finally completed, the building was a wonder. But
it was very late and badly over budget and gave Gehry a scare.

As brutal as the experience was, the process of building the Disney
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_94 .pagebreak aria-label="94"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Concert Hall taught Gehry a host of lessons that he
used in building the Guggenheim Bilbao and has used in projects ever
since. Who has power, and who doesn't? What are the interests and
agendas at work? How can you bring on board those you need and keep them
there? How do you maintain control of your design? These questions are
as important as aesthetics and engineering to the success of a project.
And the answers can't be learned in a classroom or read in a textbook
because they are not simple facts that can be put fully into words. They
need to be learned as you learn to ride a bike: try, fail, try again.
That was what Gehry did and Utzon didn't. One had built experience, the
other had not.

When Aristotle discussed the nature of wisdom more than 2,300 years ago,
he didn't scorn the knowledge we get from classrooms and textbooks. It
is essential, he said. But practical wisdom, the wisdom that enables a
person to see what's right to do and get it done, requires more than
explicit knowledge; it requires knowledge that can be gained only
through long experience---a view supported by Michael Polanyi and a
great deal of psychological research 2,300 years later. As previously
mentioned, that practical wisdom is what Aristotle called "*phronesis*."
He held it in higher regard than any other virtue, "for the possession
of the single virtue of phronesis will carry with it the possession of
them all \[i.e., all the relevant virtues\]," as he
emphasized.^[25](#notes.xhtml#note_155){#chapter005.xhtml_not_155}^

In short, if you have *phronesis,* you've got it all. Therefore, a
project leader with abundant *phronesis* is the single greatest asset a
project can have. If you have a project, hire a leader like that.

### [BACK TO *EXPERIRI*]{.sans} {.author-head1}

To go back to where I started in the previous chapter: When planning,
remember the Latin word *experiri,* the origin of the English
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_95 .pagebreak aria-label="95"
role="doc-pagebreak"}words *experiment* and *experience.* Whenever
possible, planning should maximize experience, both frozen and unfrozen.

Most big projects are not the first, tallest, biggest, or anything else
too remarkable. They are relatively ordinary highways and rail lines,
office buildings, software, hardware, change programs, infrastructure,
houses, products, movies, events, books, or home renovations. People
don't expect them to be grand cultural landmarks and legacies. Nor do
they demand that they be wildly creative and unusual. But they do want
them to be excellent. They want them to finish on budget and on time, do
what they're supposed to, do it well and reliably, and do it for a long
time. For such projects, experience can help enormously. If there is a
design---or a system, process, or technique---that has delivered many
times before, use it, or tweak it, or mix-and-match it with similarly
proven designs. Use off-the-shelf technologies. Hire experienced people.
Rely on the reliable. Don't gamble if you can avoid it. Don't be the
first. Remove the words *custom* and *bespoke* from your vocabulary.
They're a desirable option for Italian tailoring if you can afford it,
not for big projects.

Similarly, whenever possible, maximize experimentation using a highly
iterative "Pixar planning" process. Whatever the relevant mechanisms of
testing, from simple trial and error to sketches, woodand-cardboard
models, crude videos, simulations, minimum viable products, and maximum
virtual products, test everything from the big ideas down to the small
details. With good testing mechanisms that make failure relatively safe,
take calculated risks and try new ideas. But recognize that the less
proven something is, the more it must be tested.

When something works, keep it. When it doesn't, get rid of it. Try,
learn, again. And again. And again. Let the plan evolve.

Testing is all the more critical for those very rare big projects---such
as finding solutions to the climate crisis, getting people to Mars, or
permanently storing nuclear waste---that must do what has never
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_Page_96 .pagebreak aria-label="96"
role="doc-pagebreak"}been done before because that is the heart of the
project. They start with a deep deficit of experience. To deliver their
vision, on time and budget, that deficit must be turned into a surplus
with the relentless application of *experiri.*

A good plan, as I said, is one that maximizes experience or
experimentation; a great plan is one that does both. And the best plan?
That's one that maximizes experience and experimentation---and is
drafted and delivered by a project leader and team with *phronesis*.

But even with all that in hand, you still have to answer some of the
toughest questions in any project: How much will it cost? How long will
it take? Even superb plans delivered by excellent leaders and teams can
be undone if those forecasts are off. And thanks to a ubiquitous bias,
they routinely are.

Let's look at that bias---and how to overcome it.

## SO YOU THINK YOUR PROJECT IS UNIQUE? {.chapter-title}

::: ext2
*Think again. Understanding that your project is "one of those" is key
to getting your forecasts right and managing your risks.*
:::

In 2010, as China was launching one giant infrastructure project after
another, Hong Kong's Legislative Council approved a megaproject that was
ambitious even by Chinese standards: the world's first fully underground
high-speed rail system, to be known as "XRL," including the world's
largest underground high-speed rail station, four stories deep,
dynamited into bedrock, smack in the center of Hong Kong. The
twenty-six-kilometer (sixteen-mile) line would halve the travel time
between Hong Kong and the mainland city of Guangzhou, further
integrating one of the world's most important ports and financial
centers with the largest urban agglomeration on Earth, including the
Pearl River Delta Economic Zone.

XRL would be built by Mass Transit Railway (MTR), the corporation that
operates Hong Kong's giant rail network. MTR has an excellent track
record, both in its daily operations and in delivering big projects. Yet
it soon got into trouble with XRL. When construction began in 2011, it
was scheduled to be finished in 2015. But when that date arrived, less
than half the work had been done, with more than half the budget spent.
A tunnel under construction, with an expensive tunnel-boring machine
inside, had flooded. It was a mess.

[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_98 .pagebreak aria-label="98"
role="doc-pagebreak"}MTR's CEO and project director resigned over the
delay. The project was now in full meltdown. That was when I got a call
from MTR, asking me to come to Hong Kong and help.

With my team, I sat down with the MTR board of directors in their
thirty-third-floor boardroom, spectacularly overlooking Hong Kong's
skyscrapers and
harbor.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_156){#chapter006.xhtml_not_156}^ The
atmosphere was tense. Was it even possible to clean up the mess?

I assured the board that it was. I'd seen worse. But there was no margin
for error. The board had already gone back to the government to warn
that more money and time would be needed. Now the board would have to go
back again and explain exactly how much, which was excruciating in a
culture that emphasizes not losing face. We had to make sure that there
wouldn't be a third time, which meant getting the schedule and budget
right for the remaining part of the project---and delivering on both.
Everyone agreed.

Doing so required that we first understand how the mess had been
created. So we did a postmortem, as always. It is seldom pretty.

When we asked MTR what had gone wrong, we were handed the usual dirty
laundry list: Community protests had delayed the start. There had been
problems with the giant tunnel-boring machines. There had been labor
shortages. Tunneling had revealed unexpected underground conditions. The
construction site had flooded. Mitigation measures had been ineffective.
Management had felt underinformed. On it went. Combined, those factors
had created a chain of delays followed by failed efforts to catch up,
followed by more delays and more failed efforts. Staff had become
demoralized, further dragging down performance. The situation had
steadily worsened.

The specifics mattered, but the general litany was grimly familiar to
me. What was the cause? Bad planning? Bad delivery? Should we blame
managers, workers, or both? Why had a previously successful organization
failed so spectacularly on this particular project?

When delivery fails, efforts to figure out why tend to focus
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_99 .pagebreak aria-label="99"
role="doc-pagebreak"}exclusively on delivery. That's understandable, but
it's a mistake, because the root cause of why delivery fails often lies
outside delivery, in forecasting, years before delivery was even begun.

How did MTR know that its delivery was failing? By the schedule and
budget slipping. But slippage was measured against MTR's forecasts of
how long and how costly the various stages of the project would be. If
those forecasts were fundamentally unrealistic, a team expected to meet
them would fail no matter what they did. The delivery would be doomed
before it started. That should be obvious. But when things go wrong and
people get desperate, the obvious is often overlooked, and it's assumed
that if delivery fails, the problem must lie with delivery, when in fact
it lies with forecasting.

How long will it take? How much will it cost? Forecasting is critical to
any project. In this chapter, I'll explain how to get estimates right by
using a surprisingly simple and highly adaptable forecasting technique.
However, even excellent forecasts cannot cope with the rare but
disastrous turn of events such as the flooding in Hong Kong, also known
as "black swans." Those call for risk mitigation, not forecasting. I'll
show how. Then we'll get XRL back on track. That work started with a
simple question: "How did you make your forecasts?"

### [IT'S THE ESTIMATE, STUPID!]{.sans} {.author-head1}

We met Robert Caro, the acclaimed biographer, in chapter 3, where he
diligently filled the box on the right before starting a new book. But
before Caro began writing his Pulitzer Prize--winning biographies, he
had spent six years as an investigative reporter with the Long Island
newspaper *Newsday.* After writing a series of stories about a bridge
proposal backed by Robert Moses, a long-serving state bureaucrat, Caro
realized how powerful Moses was and decided to write his biography. He
knew it was an ambitious project. Moses had been shaping New York City
for more than forty years and had built []{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_100
.pagebreak aria-label="100" role="doc-pagebreak"}more megaprojects than
any other person in history. He was also secretive, preferring to stay
far from public view. Still, Caro was fairly confident that he could
complete his book in nine months and certain that he would finish within
a year.^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_157){#chapter006.xhtml_not_157}^

That forecast was critically important. Caro and his wife, Ina, had a
young son and modest savings. His advance on the book was only \$2,500
(\$22,000 in 2021 dollars). He could not afford for the project to drag
on.

But it did drag on. One year went by. Two. Three. "As year followed
year, and I was still not nearly done, I became convinced that I had
gone terribly astray," Caro recalled decades later. In conversations,
people would inevitably ask how long he had been working on the book.
"When I said three years, or four, or five, they would quickly disguise
their look of incredulity, but not quickly enough to keep me from seeing
it. I came to dread that
question."^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_158){#chapter006.xhtml_not_158}^

Caro and his wife "watched our savings run out, and we sold our house to
keep going, and the money from the sale ran
out."^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_159){#chapter006.xhtml_not_159}^ They
struggled on somehow. It took Caro *seven* years to finish his book. But
a story that seemed destined to be a tragedy ended in triumph. When *The
Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York* was finally
published in 1974, it won the Pulitzer Prize and became an improbable
bestseller. Not only is the book still in print, it is considered one of
the greatest dissections of political power ever written.

For our purposes, what matters is *why* there was such a vast and
dangerous gap between Caro's expectation and how long the work actually
took. There are two possible explanations.

One puts the blame on Caro's work. In this explanation, the forecast was
reasonable. The book would have taken a year or less to complete if
someone more experienced had written it, but Caro so badly bungled the
research and writing that he took seven times as long as necessary. For
years, he suspected that that was the case, but he couldn't figure out
what he was doing wrong. It tormented him.

[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_101 .pagebreak aria-label="101"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The other is that the forecast was a laughable
underestimate and no one could possibly have written the biography Caro
had in mind in one year. Five years into the project, when it seemed as
if the book would never be finished, Caro discovered that that was in
fact the correct explanation.

The discovery was accidental. After learning that the New York Public
Library had a room with dedicated office space for chosen writers
working on books, Caro applied and was granted a spot. For the first
time, he found himself among other book authors. Two happened to be the
authors of major historical biographies that Caro loved and considered
to be models for his own book. Caro introduced himself, and they talked.
Inevitably, Caro was asked the question he had learned to dread: "How
long have you been working on your book?" Reluctantly, he answered,
"Five years." But the other authors weren't shocked; far from it. "Oh,
that's not so long," one said. "I've been working on my Washington for
nine years." The other said that his book about Eleanor and Franklin
Roosevelt had taken seven years. Caro was ecstatic. "In a couple of
sentences, these two men---idols of mine---had wiped away five years of
doubt."^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_160){#chapter006.xhtml_not_160}^ Caro's
work was not to blame; his forecast was.

So how had Caro convinced himself that a book that would take seven
years to write could certainly be done in one? As an investigative
reporter, he had been used to taking a week or two to research and write
an article, a generous amount of time by newsroom standards. He might
spend three weeks writing a particularly long article or series of
articles, the word count of which would be roughly equivalent to that of
a book chapter. A book may have twelve chapters. So the estimate was
easy: 12 × 3 = 36 weeks, or nine months. It was not clear at the start
how many chapters the book would have, but even if it went as high as
seventeen, the book could still be finished in less than a year. For a
newspaper reporter, a year is an almost incomprehensibly long period of
time to devote to one piece of writing. It's small wonder then that Caro
was confident.

[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_102 .pagebreak aria-label="102"
role="doc-pagebreak"}In psychology, the process Caro used to create his
forecast is known as "anchoring and
adjustment."^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_161){#chapter006.xhtml_not_161}^ Your
estimate starts with some fixed point, twelve chapters of three weeks
each in Caro's case. That's the "anchor." Then you slide the figure up
or down as seems reasonable, to one year for Caro. That's "adjustment."
Caro was exactly right to call his thinking "naïve but perhaps not
unnatural" because, as abundant research shows, anchoring and
adjustment, particularly when immediate experience is used as the
anchor, is a natural way of thinking. It's likely that most people in
Caro's position, with his specific experience, would have made a
forecast the same way and come up with a similar result.

But basing forecasting on anchoring and adjustment is tricky. As
psychologists have shown in countless experiments, final estimates made
this way are biased toward the anchor, so a low anchor produces a lower
estimate than a high anchor does. That means the quality of the anchor
is critical. Use a good anchor, and you greatly improve your chance of
making a good forecast; use a bad anchor, get a bad forecast.

Unfortunately, it is easy to settle on a bad anchor. Daniel Kahneman and
Amos Tversky pioneered research on this in a famous 1974 paper that
included one of the stranger experiments in the history of psychology.
They created a "wheel of fortune," the dial of which displayed numbers
from 1 to 100. Standing in front of test subjects, they gave the wheel a
spin, and it stopped on a number. They then asked subjects to estimate
the percentage of UN members that are African. Even though the number
the wheel had selected was blatantly irrelevant, it made a big
difference to the final estimate: When the wheel of fortune stopped on,
for instance, 10, the median guess was 25 percent; when it landed on 65,
the median guess was 45
percent.^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_162){#chapter006.xhtml_not_162}^ (The
correct answer at the time of the experiment was 29 percent.) Much
subsequent research revealed that people will anchor in almost any
number they happen to be exposed to prior to making their forecast.
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_103 .pagebreak aria-label="103"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Marketers often make use of this phenomenon. When
you encounter a "limit six per customer" sign at the grocery store,
there's a good chance that the sign is there to expose you to the number
six, making it the anchor when you decide how many items to buy.

In this light, Robert Caro's thought process doesn't seem so unusual. It
used a bad anchor---his experience as a newspaper journalist---and
produced a terrible forecast that nearly ruined him and his family. But
at least it made some superficial sense.

As I discovered, it was just such a "sensible" forecast that had gotten
MTR into trouble. When MTR was planning XRL, it had lots of experience
planning and delivering big transportation infrastructure projects. But
it had no experience with high-speed rail, which is exceptionally
complex and demanding even when it doesn't involve, as it did in that
case, a cross-border and underground system. In that sense, MTR was in a
position similar to that of the young Robert Caro when he set out to
write his first book. And MTR had made its forecasts much the same way
that Caro did, using its prior experience as an anchor. The result was
similar, too; MTR's forecast for XRL---the basis of its delivery
schedule and budget---was a clear underestimate of how long a project
like this takes.

I happened to know a number of Hong Kong government insiders from
previous work in the region, whom I saw while there working for MTR on
XRL. I learned through the civil service grapevine that senior officials
had, in fact, quietly and internally questioned the XRL anchor and
suggested an upward adjustment. In big organizations there's almost
always somebody with a sense of realism. But they were lone voices.
Others were optimistic and had an interest in keeping estimates low, so
realism was seen as pessimism and ignored. Such behavior is as common as
bad anchoring and reinforces it.

The truth is that the managers and workers on XRL could not meet the
schedule they were given, no matter how hard they worked. It's unlikely
that anyone could have. From the beginning, they were sure to
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_104 .pagebreak aria-label="104"
role="doc-pagebreak"}fall behind. When that happened, MTR reacted just
as Robert Caro did---blaming the work, not the forecast---and demanded
improvements and mitigations the managers and workers could also not
deliver. More demands were made, but to no avail. The project fell
further and further behind. Then came the meltdown.

The mistake the planners made is as basic as it is common: When we
experience delays and cost overruns, we naturally go looking for things
that are slowing the project down and driving up costs. But those delays
and overruns are measured against benchmarks. Are the benchmarks
reasonable? Logically, that should be the first question that is asked,
but it rarely comes up at all. Once we frame the problem as one of time
and money overruns, it may never occur to us to consider that the real
source of the problem is not overruns at all; it is *underestimation.*
This project was doomed by a large underestimate. And the underestimate
was caused by a bad anchor.

To create a successful project estimate, you must get the anchor right.

### ["ONE OF THOSE"]{.sans} {.author-head1}

In 2003, I got a call from the UK government. Gordon Brown, who was then
finance minister and in charge of the national budget and would later
become prime minister, had a problem with major projects. They were so
routinely blowing past their expected time and cost that the government
had lost confidence in its own forecasts. And because major projects
made up a big chunk of the British budget, the government had lost
confidence in its own bottom line. By that time, making a
diagnosis---cognitive biases plus strategic misrepresentation equals
trouble---was relatively easy. Finding a cure was more work.

I started with an obscure phrase found within a paper that Daniel
Kahneman and Amos Tversky published in 1979---not the famous
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_105 .pagebreak aria-label="105"
role="doc-pagebreak"}1979 paper on "prospect theory" that won Kahneman
the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2002 but another paper the
prolific duo published the same year. The phrase is "reference
class."^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_163){#chapter006.xhtml_not_163}^

To understand what a reference class is, bear in mind that there are two
fundamentally different ways to look at a project. The first is to see
it as its own special undertaking. All projects are special to some
degree. Even if the project isn't something as wildly creative as making
a Pixar film, going to Mars, or fighting a pandemic, even if it's as
mundane as remodeling a suburban house or as common as building a small
bridge, developing a software program, or hosting a conference, at least
some aspects of the project will be unique. Maybe it's the people who
will do the work or how they will do it. Or the location. Or current
economic circumstances. Or a unique combination of these factors. There
will always be *something* that makes this project different from all
others.

People have no trouble grasping that. In fact, in my experience and in
line with the results of behavioral science, people not only tend to
naturally look at their projects this way, they tend to exaggerate just
how unusual their specific project really is. This is the "uniqueness
bias" we encountered in the previous
chapter.^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_164){#chapter006.xhtml_not_164}^ We all
have it. It makes us love our kids. But it's unfortunate in some
circumstances because it blinds us from seeing our project in the second
way.

The cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead supposedly told her students,
"You're absolutely unique, just like everyone else." Projects are like
that. Whatever sets a project apart, it shares other characteristics
with projects in its class. An opera house may be one of a kind because
of its design and location, but it still has plenty in common with other
opera houses, and we can learn a lot about how to construct a particular
opera house by looking at opera houses in general and considering our
opera house to be "one of those."The category of opera houses is the
reference class.

Kahneman and Tversky dubbed these two perspectives the "inside
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_106 .pagebreak aria-label="106"
role="doc-pagebreak"}view" (looking at the individual project in its
singularity) and the "outside view" (looking at a project as part of a
class of projects, as "one of those"). Both are valuable. But they're
very different. Although there's little danger that a forecaster will
ignore the inside view, overlooking the outside view is routine. That's
a fatal error.

To produce a reliable forecast, you need the outside view.

### [THE OUTSIDE VIEW]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Consider a scenario that is as common as it is simple: You are thinking
about renovating your kitchen, even after reading about David and
Deborah's nightmare in chapter 3, and you want to estimate the cost.
This is a DIY job, so you don't have to include labor costs. How will
you make a forecast?

If you're like almost everyone else, including many contractors, you
start by taking careful measurements. How big will the floor space be?
The walls? The ceilings? What size of cupboards and countertops do you
want? Then you decide on the type of flooring, walls, ceiling,
cupboards, drawers, countertops, sinks, faucets, fridge, oven, lights,
and so on. You find out how much those things sell for, then use the
measurements and unit costs to calculate what you must spend for each
item. Add it all up, and you have your cost estimate, simple and easy.
And thanks to the care you took in measuring and counting everything
down to the smallest detail and getting the right prices, it must be
reliable, too. Or so you assume.

You start the project by tearing out the existing flooring. And you
discover mold in the floorboards.

Then you tear out drywall. And you discover old wiring that violates the
current building code.

Later, your prized granite countertops are delivered. You slip while
carrying a slab, breaking it in two.

[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_107 .pagebreak aria-label="107"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Just like that, your estimate goes up in flames.
You are on your way to a major cost overrun.

Maybe you think I'm being unreasonable with this illustration. After
all, each of the nasty surprises I imagined is unlikely. That is true.
But even with a project as simple as a kitchen renovation, the number of
possible surprises, each unlikely, is long. Many small probabilities
added together equal a large probability that at least some of those
nasty surprises will actually come to pass. Your forecast did not
account for that. That means your forecast, which seemed perfectly
reasonable and reliable, was actually a highly unrealistic
things-will-go-according-to-plan best-case scenario, like the best-case
scenarios I described in chapter 2. And things almost *never* go
according to plan. On big projects, they don't even come close.

You may think, as most people do, that the solution is to look more
closely at your kitchen renovation, identify all the things that could
possibly go wrong, and work them into your forecast. It's not. Spotting
ways that things can go wrong is important because it enables you to
reduce or eliminate risks or mitigate them, as I'll discuss below. But
it won't get you the foolproof forecast you want, for the simple reason
that no matter how many risks you can identify, there are always many
more that you can't. They are the "unknown unknowns," to use the term
Donald Rumsfeld, then the US secretary of defense, made
famous.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_165){#chapter006.xhtml_not_165}^

But there's a way around them. You just need to start over with a
different perspective: See your project as one in a class of similar
projects already done, as "one of those." Use data from that
class---about cost, time, benefits, or whatever else you want to
forecast---as your anchor. Then adjust up or down, if necessary, to
reflect how your specific project differs from the mean in the class.
That's it. It couldn't be simpler.

That kitchen renovation? The class it belongs to is "kitchen
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_108 .pagebreak aria-label="108"
role="doc-pagebreak"}renovations." Get the mean actual cost of a kitchen
renovation. That's your anchor. If there are good reasons to think your
specific project will be above or below the mean---if, for example, you
will use high-end countertops and fixtures that cost three times what
standard items cost---adjust up or down accordingly. With that, you have
your forecast.

I know from experience that people sometimes struggle with this, not
because it's complicated but because it's simple. It's *too* simple.
Their project is special, after all, or so they think, and this process
doesn't emphasize that, so they complicate the process. They think that
if they're doing a kitchen renovation, they shouldn't say that "one of
those" is "the class of kitchen renovations." That's too easy. Instead,
they try to create a tightly drawn, complicated definition of the class
that seems to neatly fit their particular project. Instead of seeing the
class as "kitchen renovations," they call it "kitchen renovations with
granite countertops and German appliances in high-rise condominium units
located in my neighborhood." That's a mistake. It ignores a lot of
useful information. And it makes it much harder to gather the necessary
data, a challenge I'll discuss below.

The same can happen with adjustments. These should be made only if there
are clear, compelling reasons to think that your project will be well
above or below the mean. But the more you adjust, the more your project
is *different* from the average project. And your project is special! So
it feels right to adjust, adjust, and adjust some more, even if the
adjustments are based on little more than vague feelings. That, too, is
a mistake.

This is all uniqueness bias talking, wanting to be reintroduced into
your decisions when you're trying to eliminate it. Don't listen to it.
Keep the process simple: Define the class broadly. Err on the side of
inclusion. And adjust the average only when there are compelling reasons
to do so, which means that data exist that support the adjustment. When
in doubt, skip adjustment altogether. The class mean is
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_109 .pagebreak aria-label="109"
role="doc-pagebreak"}the anchor, and the anchor is your forecast. That's
very simple, yes. But simple is good; it keeps out bias.

I came to call this process "reference-class forecasting"
(RCF).^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_166){#chapter006.xhtml_not_166}^ After I
developed it for Gordon Brown, the British government used it to
forecast the time and cost of major projects and was so satisfied with
the results that it made the process
mandatory.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_167){#chapter006.xhtml_not_167}^
Denmark did the
same.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_168){#chapter006.xhtml_not_168}^ RCF has
also been used in the public and private sectors in the United States,
China, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, Switzerland, and the
Netherlands.^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_169){#chapter006.xhtml_not_169}^ All
that experience has enabled rigorous testing, and a slew of independent
studies has confirmed that "RCF indeed performs the best," in the words
of one.^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_170){#chapter006.xhtml_not_170}^

It performs the best by a large margin. The gap between a conventional
forecast and one that uses RCF varies by project type, but for over half
the projects for which we have data, RCF is better by 30 percentage
points or more. That's on average. A 50 percent increase in accuracy is
common. Improvements of more than 100 percent are not uncommon. Most
gratifyingly, given the method's intellectual roots, Daniel Kahneman
wrote in *Thinking, Fast and Slow* that using reference-class
forecasting is "the single most important piece of advice regarding how
to increase accuracy in forecasting through improved
methods."^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_171){#chapter006.xhtml_not_171}^

### [WHY DOES IT WORK?]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The core of reference-class forecasting is an anchor-and-adjustment
process similar to what Robert Caro and MTR did---but using the *right*
anchor.

What makes the reference class the right anchor is what I emphasized in
the previous chapter: relevant real-world experience. One person did a
kitchen renovation using basic fixtures and appliances; with no
surprises and a smooth delivery, it cost \$20,000 and took two weeks.
Another went with granite countertops and lots of stainless
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_110 .pagebreak aria-label="110"
role="doc-pagebreak"}steel, then discovered that the house's wiring
wasn't up to code; the project wound up costing \$40,000, and thanks to
an electrician who was overbooked, it took two months to finish. Collect
lots of these numbers, and you may find that the average kitchen
renovation cost \$30,000 and took four weeks to complete. These are
experience-based, real-world outcomes, not estimates, so they're not
distorted by psychology and strategic misrepresentation. Use them to
anchor your forecast, and you will create an estimate that is rooted in
reality, undistorted by behavioral biases, making it a better estimate.

This also explains why adjustment should be used cautiously and
sparingly, if at all. It is an opportunity for biases to creep back in.
Overdo it, and the value of your unbiased anchor may be lost.

RCF also lets you come to grips with the seemingly intractable problem
of Donald Rumsfeld's unknown unknowns. Most people think that unknown
unknowns cannot be forecasted, and that sounds reasonable. But the data
for the projects in the reference class reflect *everything* that
happened to those projects, including any unknown unknown surprises. We
may not know precisely what those events were. And we may not know how
big or how damaging they were. But we don't need to know any of that.
All we need to know is that the numbers for the reference class do
reflect how common and how big the unknown unknowns really were for
those projects, which means that your forecast will reflect those facts,
too.^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_172){#chapter006.xhtml_not_172}^

Remember David and Deborah's renovation in the Cobble Hill neighborhood
of Brooklyn? It started going downhill when the contractor tore out the
kitchen floor and discovered shoddy work done when the building had gone
up in the 1840s. The whole floor had to be torn out and supports in the
basement installed. That was an unknown unknown that would have been
difficult to spot before work began. But if the project's time and cost
had been forecast using renovations of old New York homes as the
reference class, the frequency and severity of such nasty surprises
would have been encoded []{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_111 .pagebreak
aria-label="111" role="doc-pagebreak"}into the data. As a result, the
estimated cost and time would have accounted for unknown unknowns that
can't be predicted.

So reference-class forecasting is better on biases. It's better on
unknown unknowns. It's simple and easily done. And it has a proven track
record of delivering more accurate forecasts. I'm happy that it has been
taken up to the extent that it has by different organizations around the
world---much more than I thought would ever happen when I first
developed the method for Gordon Brown---but I wouldn't blame anyone for
wondering why, given all its strengths, it isn't used even more than it
is, across the board.

There are three reasons for this. The first is that for a lot of people
and organizations, the fact that RCF eliminates biases is a bug, not a
feature. As I discussed in chapter 2, shoddy forecasting is the bread
and butter of countless corporations. They do not want the people who
authorize projects and pay the bills to have a more accurate picture of
what projects will cost and how long they will take. They're going to
stick with the status quo, at least until they're forced to change---for
instance, by assigning legal liability for blatantly biased forecasts,
which is increasingly
happening.^[18](#notes.xhtml#note_173){#chapter006.xhtml_not_173}^

A second challenge to overcome is the strength of uniqueness bias.
Kahneman writes about a time when he and some colleagues set out to
compose a textbook together. They all agreed that it would take roughly
two years. But when Kahneman asked the only member of the group with
considerable experience in producing textbooks how long it usually
takes, that expert said he couldn't recall any project taking less than
seven years. Worse, about 40 percent of such projects are never
finished, he said. Kahneman and his colleagues were briefly
alarmed---but then they moved on just as if they had never heard those
unwelcome facts because, well, their project felt different. It always
does. "This time is different" is the motto of uniqueness bias. The
textbook was ultimately finished *eight* years
later.^[19](#notes.xhtml#note_174){#chapter006.xhtml_not_174}^ If the
greatest living student of cognitive bias can be suckered by uniqueness
bias, []{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_112 .pagebreak aria-label="112"
role="doc-pagebreak"}it's small wonder that the rest of us are
vulnerable, too, or that avoiding the trap requires awareness and
sustained mental effort.

The third reason RCF is still not as widely used as it should be is the
simplest. It's the data. Calculating an average is easy, but only once
you have the numbers in hand. *That* is the hard part.

### [FIND THE DATA]{.sans} {.author-head1}

In the aforementioned kitchen renovation example, I took for granted
that you have data on kitchen renovations that will allow you to
calculate the average cost. But you probably don't. And you'll struggle
to find them. I know from experience, because I've looked for reliable
kitchen renovation data, couldn't find them, and was told by an
economist who studies the home renovation economy that, as far as he
knows, they haven't been collected. True, if you search "average cost of
kitchen renovation," you'll find companies suggesting various figures,
usually wide ranges. But where did those numbers come from? Are they
based on many actual results, or are they just a sales pitch? You can't
know. And you *must* know, if you want a reliable forecast.

This is a common problem. Old project data are seldom considered a
valuable resource and collected. In part, that's because project
planners and managers have a mindset that is focused on the future, not
the past. As soon as a project is over, their focus is on the next new
thing, and no one thinks about looking back to collect data on the old
project. But it's also because those who do see value in data often have
an interest in keeping theirs under wraps. For instance, how many big
construction companies want homeowners to have good data on home
renovation costs? This helps explain why my database of big projects,
spanning many different project types, has taken decades to develop and
is the only one of its kind in the world.

But these are not insurmountable barriers. Governments and corporations
can review their old projects and create their own databases.
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_113 .pagebreak aria-label="113"
role="doc-pagebreak"}In fact, I've helped several do so. So can small
businesses---and trade associations, if they can convince their members
to participate. Highly experienced professionals naturally learn from
past projects---a contractor who has done dozens of kitchen renovations
will have a strong sense of what an average kitchen renovation
costs---but they can refine and improve their understanding simply by
gathering numbers from their old projects and adding to those numbers
every time a project is finished.

As for those who do not have access to a database like mine or cannot
create their own, reference-class forecasting is still useful; you just
have to take a rough-and-ready approach to it.

Think about the young Robert Caro, contemplating writing his first book.
He could easily have used RCF to forecast how long his project would
take: Make a list of books he considers broadly similar to what he plans
to write, call their authors, and ask how long it took them to write
those books. If he gets twenty responses, he adds them up, divides by
twenty, and has his anchor. Even drawing upon a sample of only twenty,
he would find a ton of real-world experience packed into the number.
Then he would ask himself if there were strong reasons why he should
expect to be much faster or slower than the average. If yes, he could
adjust accordingly. If no, he has his estimate. It wouldn't be perfect,
but it would be miles better than Caro's actual estimate, because it
would be anchored in past projects like the one he was actually
doing---writing a book---instead of what he used to do, writing a set of
long newspaper articles.

In fact, Caro did something like this later, by accident, when he met
his fellow authors in the New York Public Library writing room and was
relieved to hear that they had each spent seven years or more writing
their books. But that happened long after he had started his
project---and after he had taken his family to the brink of financial
ruin and spent years tormenting himself for not finishing in one year,
as planned.

[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_114 .pagebreak aria-label="114"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The same goes for your kitchen renovation. Look
around for others who have done a kitchen renovation in, say, the past
five to ten years. Ask friends, family, co-workers. Kitchen renovations
are common, so let's say you come up with fifteen such projects. Get the
total cost of each, add them, divide by fifteen. That's your anchor.

Even simpler and even more accurate, you could get the percentage cost
overrun for each renovation and calculate their mean. Percentages are
easier to remember, and they compare better than totals do. You could
then take the estimate made the usual way---by carefully measuring your
specific project---and increase it by that percentage. In that way, you
would combine the value of the inside view (detail) with the value of
the outside view (accuracy), which is the whole game.

Of course, when it comes to the outside view, more is better, so data
from thirty projects beat data from fifteen, and data from a hundred
beat data from thirty. But it's essential to recognize that RCF can
deliver a lot of value even when there are many fewer data than we want.
With a little logic and imagination and an understanding of why RCF
works, it's possible to wring at least some value out of it even when
you have small numbers.

Even the data from just one completed project are valuable. Obviously,
it would be wrong to call that a "reference *class.*" But it *is*
realworld experience. Call it a "reference *point.*" Then compare it to
your planned project and ask, "Is our project likely to perform better
or worse than this reference point?" I know from experience that that
discussion can be surprisingly useful.

### [A TRULY UNIQUE PROJECT?]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The smallest natural number is zero. In the truly rare cases in which a
project can accurately be described as unique---the one and only of its
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_115 .pagebreak aria-label="115"
role="doc-pagebreak"}kind---that's how many projects there are in the
reference class. Yet even in that case, RCF may be useful.

In 2004, I got a call from Anders Bergendahl, the Swedish official in
charge of decommissioning nuclear power plants. He needed a reliable
estimate of how much it would cost to decommission Sweden's fleet of
nuclear power plants, which would take decades, and safely store nuclear
waste, which would last for centuries. Sweden's nuclear industry would
be asked to pay into a fund to cover those costs, so the government
needed to know how much the industry should pay. "Can you help?" he
asked.

I was stumped. At the time, I did not have data on nuclear
decommissioning projects (I do today). And I didn't think I could get
any. Very few nuclear plants had been decommissioned worldwide, and
those few had been done under very special circumstances; think
Chernobyl and Three-Mile Island. Sweden would be the first country to
carry out a planned decommissioning of a fleet of reactors. "I can't
help," I said. "Sorry."

But Bergendahl saw something I didn't. He said that consultants had
given him a report estimating the cost and the "cost risk," meaning the
risk of the cost being higher than expected. But he had noticed a
strange thing when he had compared the consultants' report with an
academic book in which my team and I had documented the cost risk for
transportation infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and rail
lines.^[20](#notes.xhtml#note_175){#chapter006.xhtml_not_175}^ According
to our book, the cost risk was higher for that very ordinary sort of
infrastructure. "That makes no sense," Bergendahl said. It takes from
five to ten years to complete transportation projects, and people have
been building them for centuries. How can it be less risky to
decommission nuclear power when it takes much longer and we have almost
no experience doing it? I agreed. That made no sense. The consultants
and their report would have to go.

But Bergendahl had an idea for a replacement. Why not use our
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_116 .pagebreak aria-label="116"
role="doc-pagebreak"}data on transportation infrastructure costs as a
"floor"---a minimum---and assume that the real cost of nuclear
decommissioning and storage would be somewhere above that? That would be
far from a perfect estimate. But it made a lot more sense than the one
the consultants had put together. And decommissioning wasn't starting
soon. If the Swedish government put that estimate into place now and got
the nuclear industry to start paying into the fund, the government could
adjust the estimate later as more was learned about decommissioning in
Sweden and elsewhere. I was impressed. It was such a commonsense
approach---*phronesis,* again. We worked to develop it, and it became
Swedish policy.^[21](#notes.xhtml#note_176){#chapter006.xhtml_not_176}^

The uncomfortable truth is that I myself had fallen for "uniqueness
bias" by assuming that a project as unprecedented as nuclear power plant
decommissioning had nothing to learn from the experience of other
projects. Not true; as Bergendahl showed, it just took a little logic
and imagination to see it.

### [REGRESSION TO THE TAIL]{.sans} {.author-head1}

There is, however, a big, fat-tailed caveat on all this. Imagine you
have a graph with the costs of one thousand kitchen renovations that
takes the shape of a classic bell curve---with most projects clustered
around the mean in the middle, very few projects on the far right or far
left, and even the most extreme data points not far removed from the
mean. As I discussed in chapter 1, that's what statisticians call a
"normal distribution."

In a normal distribution, there is regression to the mean, meaning that
the observations in a sample tend to move back toward the mean of the
population as more observations are included. So if a contractor
completes an unusually expensive kitchen renovation, it is likely that
the next one, other things being equal, will be closer to the mean and
therefore cheaper.

[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_117 .pagebreak aria-label="117"
role="doc-pagebreak"}When you're dealing with a normal distribution,
it's fine to use the mean cost in a reference-class forecast, as I
described above, and call it a day. But as noted in chapter 1, my
analysis revealed that only a minority of the many project types in my
database are "normally" distributed. The rest---from the Olympic Games
to IT projects to nuclear power plants and big dams---have more extreme
outcomes in the tails of their distributions. With these fat-tailed
distributions, the mean is not representative of the distribution and
therefore is not a good estimator for forecasts. For the most fat-tailed
distributions, there isn't even a stable mean that you can expect
outcomes to cluster around because an even more extreme outcome can (and
will) come along and push the mean further out, into the tail toward
infinity. So instead of good old regression to the mean, you get what I
call "regression to the
tail."^[22](#notes.xhtml#note_177){#chapter006.xhtml_not_177}^ In that
situation, relying on the mean and assuming that your result will be
close to it is a dangerous
mistake.^[23](#notes.xhtml#note_178){#chapter006.xhtml_not_178}^

So much for the theory. What does this mean in practice?

Ideally, you'd always want to know whether you're facing a fattailed
distribution or not. But if you're a private individual doing a kitchen
renovation or a small business doing a minor project, you might not
know. Even if you're a top civil servant in control of a national
program with the firepower of your national statistical agency at your
disposal, like Anders Bergendahl, you may not know. In that case you're
better off using the average---or using your imagination, as Bergendahl,
who didn't even know his average, did---than using nothing.

But following the precautionary principle, you should also err on the
side of caution and assume that your project is part of a fat-tailed
distribution, because this is more likely to be the case than not. That
means you should assume that your project has at least some risk of not
merely finishing a little late or a little over budget; it may go
haywire and end very badly. To protect yourself against that, you need
to mitigate risk, as I describe below.

[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_118 .pagebreak aria-label="118"
role="doc-pagebreak"}If you're a professional at a large organization,
you should do better than this rough-and-ready approach. You need to get
serious about gathering enough data to allow you to statistically
analyze the distribution and determine if it's normal or fat-tailed. If
it's normal or near normal, do a reference-class forecast using the
mean. This would still give you an approximately 50 percent risk of a
small cost overrun. If you want to reduce this risk further, add a 10 to
15 percent contingency (reserve), and you're
done.^[24](#notes.xhtml#note_179){#chapter006.xhtml_not_179}^

If you face a fat-tailed distribution, shift your mindset from
forecasting a single outcome ("The project will cost X") to forecasting
risk ("The project is X percent likely to cost more than Y"), using the
full range of the distribution. In a typical fat-tailed distribution in
project management, about 80 percent of the outcomes will make up the
body of the distribution. That's pretty normal; nothing really scary
there. For that portion of the distribution, you can protect yourself
the usual way with affordable contingencies that will fit into a budget.
But the tail outcomes---the "black swans"---cover about 20 percent of
the distribution. That means a 20 percent chance of ending up in the
tail, which is too much risk for most organizations. Contingencies might
have to be 300, 400, or 500 percent over the average cost---or 700
percent, as we saw for the Montreal Olympics in chapter 2. That's
prohibitive. Providing such contingencies would not be budgeting; it
would be blowing up the budget. So what can you do about the tail? Cut
it off.

You can do that with risk mitigation. I call it "black swan management."

### [BLACK SWAN MANAGEMENT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Some tails are simple to cut. Tsunamis are fat-tailed, but if you build
well inland or erect a high enough seawall, you eliminate the threat.
Earthquakes are also fat-tailed, but build to an earthquake-proof
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_119 .pagebreak aria-label="119"
role="doc-pagebreak"}standard, as we did with the schools in Nepal, and
you are covered. Other tails require a combination of measures; for a
pandemic, for instance, a blend of masks, tests, vaccines, quarantines,
and lockdowns to prevent infections from running
wild.^[25](#notes.xhtml#note_180){#chapter006.xhtml_not_180}^ That's
black swan management.

For big projects, black swan management typically requires a combination
of measures. I started this book with one: "Think slow, act fast." We
saw that delivery is when things can go horribly and expensively wrong.
Exhaustive planning that enables swift delivery, narrowing the time
window that black swans can crash through, is an effective means of
mitigating this risk. Finishing is the ultimate form of black swan
prevention; after a project is done, it can't blow up, at least not as
regards delivery.

The critical next step is to stop thinking of black swans the way most
people do. They are not bolt-from-the-blue freak accidents that are
impossible to understand or prevent. They can be studied. And mitigated.

My team and I were asked to do just that for High Speed 2, or HS2, a
\$100 billion--plus high-speed rail line that will run from London to
northern England, if and when it is
completed.^[26](#notes.xhtml#note_181){#chapter006.xhtml_not_181}^ Using
our database, we first explored the cost distribution of comparable
highspeed rail projects around the world. Sure enough, the distribution
had a fat tail. High-speed rail is risky business, as we saw in Hong
Kong. So we zeroed in on the projects in the tail and investigated what
exactly had made each project blow up. The answers were surprisingly
simple. The causes had not been "catastrophic" risks such as terrorism,
strike actions, or other surprises; they had been standard risks that
every project already has on its risk register. We identified roughly a
dozen of those and found that projects were undone by the compound
effects of these on a project already under stress. We found that
projects seldom nosedive for a single reason.

One of the most common sources of trouble for high-speed rail
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_120 .pagebreak aria-label="120"
role="doc-pagebreak"}was archaeology. In many parts of the world, and
certainly in England, construction projects are built on layers of
history. The moment a project starts digging, there's a good chance it
will uncover relics of the past. When it does, the law requires that
work stop until a qualified archaeologist can survey the site, document
it, remove artifacts, and ensure that nothing significant is lost.
Experienced managers know this and keep an archaeologist on speed dial.

Normally, that's enough. But sometimes big projects cut through cities
and landscapes, so when artifacts are discovered at one site and the
archaeologists get to work, artifacts are found at another site soon
after. And another. And another. There just aren't that many
archaeologists, and, unlike plumbers or electricians, responding to
emergency calls isn't a normal part of their work. So when multiple
discoveries overlap, the delays can become severe. And those delays can
in turn delay other work. The result is a chain reaction of setbacks,
like a line of cars sliding into one another on an icy street. In this
way, what starts as one minor fender bender becomes gridlock capable of
derailing the whole project.

Given the amount of digging HS2 would require, that was a major risk.
The solution? Put every qualified archaeologist in the country on a
retainer. That's not cheap. But it's a lot cheaper than keeping a
multibillion-dollar project on hold. So it makes sense. And after
construction started, it had the additional effect of archaeology
becoming the one area where news perceived as positive by the general
public originated directly with the project, promoted by HS2 as the
largest archaeology program ever undertaken in the United
Kingdom.^[27](#notes.xhtml#note_182){#chapter006.xhtml_not_182}^

We also found that early delays in procurement and political decisions
correlated with black swan blowouts in the HS2 reference class.
Interestingly, early delays are not seen as a big deal by most project
leaders. They figure they have time to catch up, precisely because the
delays happen early. That sounds reasonable. But it's dead wrong. Early
delays cause chain reactions throughout the delivery process.
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_121 .pagebreak aria-label="121"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The later a delay comes, the less remaining work
there is and the less the risk and impact of a chain reaction. President
Franklin Roosevelt got it right when he said, "Lost ground can always be
regained---lost time
never."^[28](#notes.xhtml#note_183){#chapter006.xhtml_not_183}^ Knowing
this, we advised measures that would cut the probability of early delays
and chain reactions.

After dealing with archaeology and early delays, we had ten more items
on the list of causes of high-speed rail black swans, including late
design changes, geological risks, contractor bankruptcy, fraud, and
budget cuts. We went through one after another, looking for ways to
reduce the risk. By the end, we had a bundle of measures that reduced
black swan risk arising from each cause *and* from their interaction.

That's how you cut the tail of a big, complex project. The procedure
will be somewhat different from project to project, but the principles
are the same. And the answers are right under your nose in the tail of
the reference class; you just need to dig them out.

As with reference-class forecasting, the big hurdle to black swan
management is overcoming uniqueness bias. If you imagine that your
project is so different from other projects that you have nothing to
learn from them, you will overlook risks that you would catch and
mitigate if you instead switched to the outside view. A startling
illustration---a cautionary tale, in fact---is provided by the Great
Chicago Fire Festival.

### [THE GREAT CHICAGO FIRE FESTIVAL]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The story of the fire that destroyed most of Chicago in 1871 runs deep
in local culture, so Jim Lasko, the creative director of a Chicago
theater company, pitched the idea of a one-day festival that would
culminate in the spectacular burning of replica Victorian houses. The
mayor's office loved it and signed off on it.

The very name Great Chicago Fire Festival highlighted the
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_122 .pagebreak aria-label="122"
role="doc-pagebreak"}potential for disaster, so the fire department
carefully examined Lasko's plans and demanded a litany of safety
measures, including building the houses on a barge in the river and
installing a sophisticated sprinkler system. For Lasko, it was
aggravating and exhausting, but the months of this relentless focus on
risk were also a comfort. If live events go wrong, they go wrong in
front of an audience.

In October 2014, before a crowd of thirty thousand people, including the
mayor and the governor, Lasko held up a walkie-talkie and gave the order
to light the fire. Nothing happened. He waited. Still nothing. The
ignition system had failed. There was no backup and no contingency plan.
All the effort had gone into mitigating the risk of the fire spreading,
not the risk of the fire not igniting in the first place.

A politician later called the festival "the fiasco on the river," and
the name stuck. The event became a punch line. The theater company
ultimately folded, and Lasko lost his
job.^[29](#notes.xhtml#note_184){#chapter006.xhtml_not_184}^

What went wrong? Lasko and his team spent ages thinking about risk, but
they never shifted their perspective from thinking of the Great Chicago
Fire Festival as a unique project to seeing it as "one of those"; that
is, part of a wider class of projects. If they had, they would have
spent time thinking about live events. How do they fail? One common way
is equipment failure. Mics don't work. Computers crash. How is that risk
mitigated? Simple: Identify essential equipment, get backups, and make
contingency plans. That kind of analysis is dead easy---but only *after*
you have shifted to the outside view.

Notice that risk mitigation does not require predicting the *exact*
circumstances that lead to disaster. Jim Lasko didn't need to identify
when and how the ignition system would fail, only recognize that it
could. And have a Plan B if it did.

Recall what Benjamin Franklin wrote in 1758: "A little neglect may breed
great mischief." This is why high safety standards are an excellent form
of risk mitigation and a must on all projects. They're
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_123 .pagebreak aria-label="123"
role="doc-pagebreak"}not just good for workers; they prevent little
things from combining in unpredictable ways into project-smashing black
swans.

Black swans are not fate. We are not at their mercy. That said, it is
important to acknowledge that risk mitigation---like most things in
life---is a matter of probability, not certainty. I started this book
with the story of the Empire State Building, which was so skillfully
planned and swiftly delivered that it came in substantially under budget
and a little ahead of schedule. That was superb risk mitigation. What I
didn't mention is that, despite doing everything right, the project,
which was launched in the Roaring Twenties, was unfortunately finished
during the Great Depression, a turn of events no one had seen coming. In
the devastated economy, the Empire State Building struggled to attract
paying tenants and was nicknamed the "Empty State Building" during the
1930s. Not until the economy revived after the Second World War did it
become profitable.

In this complex world, we can and must move the probabilities in our
favor, but we can never achieve certainty. Good risk managers know this
in their bones and are prepared for it.

### [BACK TO HONG KONG]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Now let's go back to that underground high-speed rail project in Hong
Kong.

MTR got into trouble with the XRL project when it used the wrong
anchor---its own experience with urban and conventional rail. Toss in
some optimism bias, add ambition, and MTR created a delivery schedule
that was doomed from the outset. When work inevitably fell behind
schedule, managers and workers were blamed. A downward spiral of failure
and recrimination followed.

To get MTR out of that spiral, we started by going back to the beginning
and making our own forecast of the project, but this time
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_124 .pagebreak aria-label="124"
role="doc-pagebreak"}it was a reference-class forecast using the right
anchor. Of course, we couldn't use a large reference class of
underground high-speed rail projects because XRL was the world's first.
Instead, we used worldwide data for 189 high-speed rail, tunneling, and
urban rail projects that statistical tests had shown were comparable to
XRL. This is RCF in its most sophisticated form, possible only when you
have a rich
database.^[30](#notes.xhtml#note_185){#chapter006.xhtml_not_185}^ The
forecast showed that what MTR had tried to do in four years should take
six. No wonder it had gotten into trouble.

We also went back and did risk mitigation. We found, for example, that
if a boring machine broke down, engineers and parts were ordered from
the manufacturer. And people waited until they arrived. That made no
sense. In Formula 1 racing, where every second counts, the pit stop has
engineers and a wide array of spare parts on hand to keep delays to an
absolute minimum. I told MTR that time was as important to them as it
was to an F1 team, and MTR was spending a lot more money, so they should
do the same. We also noted that procurement and delivery were often
accompanied by delays as lowerlevel employees at MTR contacted
lower-level employees at the supplier. We advised that such decisions be
pushed up the ladder, so that the CEO of MTR would contact the CEO of
the supplier---a remarkably effective way to accelerate response time,
we found.

The next step was getting MTR back on track. To do that, we made another
reference-class forecast for the remaining work, roughly half of the
total. The estimate had to be high confidence because MTR had only one
more shot at getting approval from the Hong Kong government for more
time and money. Having data from almost two hundred relevant projects to
draw on enabled us to statistically model the uncertainties, risks, and
likely outcomes of various strategies. Then MTR could decide how much
risk it was willing to take. I told the MTR board that it was like
buying insurance. "How insured do you want to be against further time
and budget overruns? Fifty percent? []{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_125
.pagebreak aria-label="125" role="doc-pagebreak"}Seventy? Ninety?" The
more insured you want to be, the more money you have to set
aside.^[31](#notes.xhtml#note_186){#chapter006.xhtml_not_186}^

A settlement was eventually reached between MTR and the government in
November 2015. But even before then, we got to work on improving
delivery.

If the data are detailed enough, as ours were, it's possible to forecast
not only a whole project but sections of a project, using the same
reference-class forecasting technique. Doing this, we set milestones,
the well-known management tool that places markers for the project to
pass by specified dates.

But if a project is falling behind, managers don't want to wait until
the next milestone arrives before they are alerted to the delay. They
need to know and act as quickly as possible. Our data were so detailed
that we could make a further set of subforecasts, so we invented
"inchstones." And we specified in detail beforehand who would be
responsible for what. If MTR started falling behind under the new
schedule, managers would know immediately, and they would know who must
act, so no time would be wasted. With the Hong Kong government, we
developed the inchstone approach into a general methodology based on
artificial intelligence, which today is used on other Hong Kong projects
and can be used on any project
anywhere.^[32](#notes.xhtml#note_187){#chapter006.xhtml_not_187}^

The final step in turning XRL around was owning the mistake. MTR did
that, starting with a public apology by a top official. New leaders were
hired and policies changed to reflect the problems we identified.
Perhaps most important, management started celebrating progress against
inchstones and milestones. The spiral of negativity was replaced by an
updraft of accomplishment that everyone could feel. The whole turnaround
process took ninety very intense days and nights.

Four years later, early on the morning of September 22, 2018, Hong
Kong's spectacular new underground railway station with its
[]{#chapter006.xhtml_Page_126 .pagebreak aria-label="126"
role="doc-pagebreak"}dramatically curved rooftop green spaces welcomed
the first travelers. At precisely 7:00 [A.M]{.small}., the first bullet
train slipped quietly into a tunnel and raced to mainland China. The
project had been concluded on budget and three months ahead of
schedule---the budget and schedule created by using the right anchor.

So now we can put reference-class forecasting and risk management into
the toolbox, along with experience, Pixar planning, and thinking from
right to left. These are the essential tools for thinking slow in
planning before acting fast in delivery.

That said, I have to admit something: Some people think my approach is
not only wrong but the opposite of how we should tackle big projects. In
the next chapter, I'll examine their argument and put it---and mine---to
the test.

## CAN IGNORANCE BE YOUR FRIEND? {.chapter-title}

::: ext2
*Planning ruins projects, some say. Just get going! Trust your
ingenuity! It's a wonderful sentiment backed by superb stories.*

*But is it true?*
:::

As the 1960s were coming to a close, Jimi Hendrix was a
twenty-five-year-old psychedelic rock star who spent his nights soaking
up the bohemian atmosphere of Manhattan's Greenwich Village. One of his
favorite nightclubs was a little place called the Generation. In early
1969, Hendrix took over the lease.

Hendrix luxuriated in the club's laid-back vibe, relaxing for hours with
friends and jamming with other musicians. He wanted more of that---plus
a space where musicians could record jam sessions on a simple
eight-track tape machine. To redesign the club, he hired John Storyk, a
twenty-two-year-old who had recently graduated from Princeton
University's architecture school and whose only building experience was
designing the decor of an experimental nightclub that Hendrix had
wandered into and loved. That was enough. Storyk started drawing.

Hendrix also asked Eddie Kramer, his twenty-six-year-old sound engineer,
to take a look. Kramer had worked with Hendrix for two years. He knew
him as an artist and a person, and he knew his business affairs. Kramer
had a strong reaction when he first visited the club, accompanied by the
man Hendrix had hired to manage it. "I []{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_128
.pagebreak aria-label="128" role="doc-pagebreak"}walked down the stairs
at what was the Generation nightclub," he recalled half a century later,
"and I said, 'You guys are out of your f \*\*\*ing
minds.'"^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_188){#chapter007.xhtml_not_188}^

It would cost Hendrix a fortune to remodel the club, Kramer reasoned.
And what would he get in exchange? A nightclub where he could relax and
jam, sure. But the recordings produced during those jam sessions would
be suboptimal. Meanwhile, Hendrix would continue to spend as much as
\$200,000 a year (roughly \$1.5 million in 2021 dollars) for studio
sessions to record his albums. Why not build a private recording studio
instead? It could be a place designed from top to bottom as an
expression of Hendrix's personal aesthetic and artistic spirit, a place
as inspiring and comfortable for him as any nightclub could be. But it
would also be a top-quality recording studio where he could record
top-quality albums---and keep the fortune he spent every year on studio
time.

In 1969, that was a daringly innovative idea. Not even the biggest stars
owned their own studios. And commercial studios tended to be sterile
boxes where technicians wore white lab coats. Hendrix was convinced; the
nightclub project was now a studio project.

### [ELECTRIC LADY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

John Storyk had almost finished redesigning the Generation when he was
told about the change of plans. He was crushed. He thought he was fired.
But Kramer and Hendrix's studio manager said no. "They said, 'You can
stay, and you can become the designer for the studio.'"

"I said, 'Guys, I don't know anything about studios. I've never even
been in a studio.'

"They said, 'That's
okay.'"^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_189){#chapter007.xhtml_not_189}^

That freewheeling spirit permeated the project. Hendrix gave Kramer and
Storyk a remarkably free hand to create a studio unlike any other---a
studio designed exclusively to cater to one artist's "needs,
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_129 .pagebreak aria-label="129"
role="doc-pagebreak"}tastes, whims, and fancies," as Eddie Kramer
described it. But Hendrix did have one, very specific request. Recalling
it, Kramer dropped his voice and did an excellent impression of the
1960s icon. "Hey, man," he said. "I want some round windows."

Storyk made six drawings on tracing paper of what he thought a recording
studio fit for Jimi Hendrix should look like. Those drawings became the
plan. The whole plan. There was no schedule. There was no budget. "The
entire studio was built from six drawings and a lot of pointing," Storyk
said with a laugh.

When construction began, problems sprouted like magic mushrooms. A major
one was the discovery of an underground river flowing beneath the
building. It required the installation of sump pumps that would have to
operate around the clock. But the pumps created background noise that
was unacceptable for a recording studio, so they had to be muffled
somehow. "That set the project back weeks and weeks," Storyk said with a
sigh.

They invented on the fly. In most rooms, ceilings are afterthoughts,
nothing more than a place to hang light fixtures. But in a recording
studio, the ceiling has to absorb ambient sound. Storyk and Kramer
learned from acousticians that they inject air into plaster to make it
more sound absorbent, so they dreamed up a way to get extra air into the
plaster by whipping it with commercial eggbeaters.

Financing was a bigger problem. Hendrix made a lot of money from
concerts and records, but his cash flow was irregular. "We would do
construction for a month, a month and a half, two months, and the money
would run out," Kramer recalled. The tradesmen would be laid off, "the
site would be shut down, and Jimi would go on the road." When Hendrix
did a concert, he was paid in cash. Bags were stuffed with tens of
thousands of dollars. Someone in the Hendrix entourage flew the bags
back to Manhattan and handed them to Hendrix's managers. "And we could
get the project started again."

As construction dragged on and bills piled up, Hendrix couldn't
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_130 .pagebreak aria-label="130"
role="doc-pagebreak"}sustain the airdrops, but his manager convinced
Warner Bros., Hendrix's record label, to put in hundreds of thousands of
dollars. That barely got the project over the finish line. It had taken
a year and cost more than \$1 million---adjusted for fifty years of
inflation, that's roughly \$7.5 million---but it was done. Inspired by
his most recent album, *Electric Ladyland,* Hendrix called the studio
Electric Lady, later renamed Electric Lady Studios.

An opening party was held on August 26, 1970. Patti Smith, Eric Clapton,
Steve Winwood, Ron Wood, and other fellow stars were
there.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_190){#chapter007.xhtml_not_190}^ The studio
had the perfect Hendrix vibe, with ambient lighting, curved walls, and,
of course, round windows. "It was a womblike place to be in," Kramer
recalled. "Jimi felt incredibly happy, comfortable, and creative in it."
And the sound blew people away. Musicians call it "tight." Only decades
later did Storyk have the technology to take measurements that confirmed
why: The plaster on the ceiling absorbed midrange sound, as expected,
but also, to his surprise, lowfrequency sound. The eggbeaters turned out
to be a stroke of genius.

Tragically, Jimi Hendrix died less than a month after his studio opened,
and the world lost the lifetime of brilliant music he surely would have
produced. But his studio lived on. Stevie Wonder recorded there. Then
came Led Zeppelin, Lou Reed, the Rolling Stones, John Lennon, David
Bowie, AC/DC, the Clash, and a long list of others. And it's *still*
going. U2, Daft Punk, Adele, Lana Del Rey, and Jay-Z have all recorded
in what is now the oldest working recording studio in New York City and
one of the most famous studios in the world.

"I still have the six drawings," Storyk said of the original design. A
famous tech mogul once offered to buy them for \$50,000. "Not for sale.
Still in the tube. The Museum of Modern Art has said they'll take them."

The project was a leap in the dark: An ethereal artist impulsively
authorized two kids with little experience and no plan to design and
deliver an unprecedented project that he paid for with literal bags of
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_131 .pagebreak aria-label="131"
role="doc-pagebreak"}cash. By all rights, it should have ended badly. At
some points, such as when Hendrix ran out of cash, it seemed it would.
It took ages to complete. It cost a fortune. But in the end, the project
paid off beyond anyone's wildest dream.

### [JUST DO IT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

I love Jimi Hendrix, and I love this story. Who wouldn't? There's
something deeply appealing about people daring to skip planning and just
throw themselves into a big project---then dreaming, scheming, and
hustling their way through challenges to deliver a grand success. It's
romantic---which is not a word people often use to describe planning.

The story of Electric Lady also squares with a widespread view of
creativity as something that is mysterious and spontaneous. It can't be
scheduled and planned. The most you can do is put yourself into a
position where creativity is needed and trust that it will appear.
"Necessity is the mother of invention," after all.

From this, it's easy to conclude that the sort of careful planning I
advise in this book is unnecessary---or worse, that careful planning
reveals problems. With problems revealed and no solutions in hand, you
may decide that the project is too difficult and give up---and never
discover the solutions you would have invented if you had blindly
plunged ahead.

According to this perspective, "Just do it" is much better advice. "I
think things are better done spontaneously," said a woman whose major
house renovation was featured in a BBC series. She bought the house at
auction without first doing a proper inspection or any serious planning
of the renovation. That was deliberate, she said. "Too much planning,
and you tend not to do
it."^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_191){#chapter007.xhtml_not_191}^

This thinking has some powerful intellectual backing. Half a century
ago, Albert O. Hirschman was a renowned economist at
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_132 .pagebreak aria-label="132"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Columbia University when he wrote an essay that has
been influential ever
since.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_192){#chapter007.xhtml_not_192}^ In recent
years, the journalist Malcolm Gladwell wrote glowingly about it in *The
New Yorker,* as did Harvard professor and former White House official
Cass R. Sunstein in *The New York Review of
Books*.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_193){#chapter007.xhtml_not_193}^ In 2015,
the Brookings Institution, a prominent Washington, DC, think tank,
reissued the book in which Hirschman's text first appeared as a
Brookings Classic, with a new foreword and afterword, to celebrate
Hirschman's thinking and the upcoming fiftieth anniversary of the book's
publication.^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_194){#chapter007.xhtml_not_194}^

Hirschman argued that planning is a bad idea. "Creativity always comes
as a surprise to us," he wrote. "Therefore, we can never count on it and
we dare not believe in it until it has happened." But if we know that
big projects pose big challenges that can be overcome only by creativity
and we don't trust creativity to deliver its magic when we need it, why
would anyone ever launch a big project? They shouldn't. Yet they do. For
that, Hirschman argued, we must thank ignorance; it's our friend in
getting projects started. He called it "providential
ignorance."^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_195){#chapter007.xhtml_not_195}^

When we ponder a big project, Hirschman observed, we routinely fail to
see the number and severity of the challenges the project will pose.
This ignorance makes us too optimistic. And that's a good thing,
according to Hirschman. "Since we necessarily underestimate our
creativity," he wrote, "it is desirable that we underestimate to a
roughly similar extent the difficulties of the tasks we face, so as to
be tricked by these two offsetting underestimates into undertaking tasks
which we can, but otherwise would not dare, tackle."

In Hirschman's view, people "typically" underestimate the costs and
difficulties of big projects, leading to budget overruns and blown
schedules.^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_196){#chapter007.xhtml_not_196}^ But
these negatives are dwarfed by the projects' larger-than-expected
benefits. He suggested a name for this principle: "Since we are
apparently on the trail here of some sort of Invisible or Hidden
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_133 .pagebreak aria-label="133"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Hand that beneficially hides difficulties from us,
I propose 'the Hiding Hand.'"

Hirschman illustrated his idea with a story about a paper mill built in
what is now Bangladesh. The mill was designed to exploit nearby bamboo
forests. But shortly after the mill started operating, all the bamboo
flowered and died, a natural cycle that happens every half century. With
the mill's raw material gone, the operators had no choice but to find
alternatives. They came up with three: They created new supply chains to
bring bamboo from other regions; they developed and planted a
faster-growth species to replace the bamboo that was lost; and they
invented new methods to substitute other kinds of lumber.

In the end, according to Hirschman's telling of the story, a burst of
creativity born of desperation made the mill better off than if the
original bamboo had lived. But what if the planners had done a better
job and had become aware of the fact that the bamboo in the region would
soon die off? The mill might never have been built. As strange as it
sounds, in this case bad planning saved the day, or so Hirschman
argued.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_197){#chapter007.xhtml_not_197}^

Hirschman provided a handful of other examples from the economic
development projects that were his specialty, but it's not hard to find
others in radically different fields. One of my favorites is *Jaws,* the
movie that made director Steven Spielberg a household name. By common
agreement, the production was a mess. The script was terrible. The
weather was uncooperative. The mechanical sharks malfunctioned---one
sank---and they looked goofy, not scary. According to Peter Biskind's
classic film history, *Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the
Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'n' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood,* filming took
three times longer than expected, costs went three times over budget,
and Spielberg was driven to the edge of a nervous breakdown, fearing his
career would be destroyed.

[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_134 .pagebreak aria-label="134"
role="doc-pagebreak"}So how did *Jaws* become one of the most successful
movies of all time? The terrible script compelled the actors and
director to invent scenes and dialogue together, including moments that
gave the characters real depth. And the deficiencies of the mechanical
sharks forced Spielberg to shift the focus to the people and only hint
at the terror in the water for most of the movie, which turned out to be
a lot scarier than any image of a shark. Those two innovations elevated
a schlocky B-movie into a box-office smash hit and a masterpiece of
suspense.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_198){#chapter007.xhtml_not_198}^

We saw another epic story that fits Hirschman's argument a couple of
chapters back: The difficulty of turning Jørn Utzon's "magnificent
doodle" into the Sydney Opera House was badly underestimated, but
construction went ahead, Utzon eventually cracked the puzzle, and
although the project went vastly over budget, took far too long, and was
internally flawed, the opera house ultimately became one of the world's
great buildings.

And we have to put Electric Lady onto the list. The project those two
kids took on in 1969 was insanely difficult, but they plunged ahead,
worked hard, and invented solutions as they moved along. When I spoke
with Storyk and Kramer recently, it was obvious how much pride they have
in what they accomplished. And rightly so.

These are compelling stories. And that's a problem for me because I
can't overstate how contrary Hirschman's argument is to mine. If he's
right, I'm wrong and vice versa. It's that simple.

### [STORIES VERSUS DATA]{.sans} {.author-head1}

So how can we figure out who's right? Typically, people don't have
sufficient data to determine that, so they try to settle the
debate---creative chaos versus planning---with stories. I get this all
the time, even from scholars. It's how Hirschman made his argument in
the []{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_135 .pagebreak aria-label="135"
role="doc-pagebreak"}first place. And it's how Cass Sunstein, Malcolm
Gladwell, and many others were enticed by it.

On one side are stories such as *Jaws,* the Sydney Opera House, Electric
Lady, and more.

And on the other? I could respond by noting, for example, that the woman
I quoted above---who said, "Too much planning, and you tend not to do
it"---is one-half of the London couple I mentioned in chapter 1 whose
house renovation soared from an initial estimate of \$260,000 to more
than \$1.3 million and counting. It might not have been a bad thing if
"too much planning" had stopped them from buying that house.

That would be a good story. But let's be honest, it wouldn't be nearly
as good as the one about *Jaws.*

It's not just the drama of my story that would come up short. So would
the number of stories I could collect, for a simple reason: Projects
that run into trouble and end in miserable failure are soon forgotten
because most people aren't interested in miserable failures; projects
that run into trouble but persevere and become smash successes are
remembered and celebrated.

Consider *Jaws:* When it was finished and about to be released, Steven
Spielberg was sure that it would bomb and destroy his career. If it had,
only Spielberg and a few film historians would even remember *Jaws*
today. The same is true of the Sydney Opera House and all the rest. If
the Electric Lady project had been abandoned before it was completed or
if the finished studio had possessed terrible acoustics, it would have
been sold off---to be turned into a shoe store, perhaps---and the only
lingering traces of the story would be found in the endnotes of Jimi
Hendrix biographies. And maybe the round windows.

We can see this reality in the first and second movies directed by the
young Dennis Hopper. In the late 1960s, Hopper was a volatile,
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_136 .pagebreak aria-label="136"
role="doc-pagebreak"}drug-taking hippie who didn't believe in scripts,
plans, and budgets. The first movie he directed was *Easy Rider.* I
vividly remember watching it several times, transfixed, as a teenager in
Denmark. And I was far from alone. *Easy Rider* was a global commercial
and critical success and is generally considered a landmark of the era.
And the second one? I don't know if I ever saw it. At first, I couldn't
even recall its title. Hopper brought the same manic, improvisational
approach to that movie, but it was a disaster that only serious film
buffs can name today. (I looked it up. It's called *The Last Movie.*)

In the social sciences, "survivorship bias" is the common mistake of
noting only those things that made it through some selection process
while overlooking those that didn't. Someone could note, for example,
that Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg all dropped out of
university and conclude that a key to success in information technology
is to leave school. What's missing, and what makes that odd conclusion
possible, are the dropouts who went nowhere in information technology
and are ignored. That's survivorship bias.

If we consider only stories, survivorship bias will always favor
Hirschman's account because projects that overcome adversity with a
burst of creativity and deliver great triumphs are like dropouts who
become billionaires; they're great stories, so they get noticed. To get
at who's right, we need to know about the other dropouts, too, even
though they are not great stories and no one has ever heard of them. We
need more than stories. We need data.

### [WHAT THE DATA SAY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Hirschman never produced data, only eleven case studies, which are far
too few to establish that the pattern he claimed was, in his words,
"typical" and a "general principle" was in fact real, let alone typical
or general.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_199){#chapter007.xhtml_not_199}^ But
as I discussed in chapter 1, I've got lots of numbers thanks to spending
decades building a big database of big projects. So
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_137 .pagebreak aria-label="137"
role="doc-pagebreak"}I did some analysis using a sample of 2,062
projects comparable to those studied by Hirschman---everything from dams
to rail lines, tunnels, bridges, and buildings. In 2016, I published the
resulting paper in the academic journal *World Development.*

If Hirschman is right, a typical project should see parallel mistakes: A
failure to foresee the difficulty in the project should produce an
underestimate of the final cost, while a failure to foresee how creative
the project leaders would be in response to difficulties should produce
an underestimate of the project's benefits. That's the pattern with
*Jaws,* the Sydney Opera House, and Electric Lady: They fit Hirschman's
theory.

We should also see that the overrun on benefits---the extent to which
the good stuff generated by the project exceeded what was expected---is
bigger than the overrun on costs. Again, that's what we see in all these
cases: The 300 percent cost overrun on *Jaws* was big, but the movie
crushed expectations at the box office to more than compensate. Much
more.

So what did the data show? Not that. The benefit overrun of the average
project does not exceed the cost overrun. In fact, there is no benefit
overrun.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_200){#chapter007.xhtml_not_200}^

Put simply, the typical project is one in which costs are
*underestimated* and benefits are *overestimated.* Picture a big project
that costs *more* than it was supposed to and delivered *less* than
expected: That description fit four out of five projects. Only one in
five squared with what Hirschman's theory says should be the norm. To be
blunt, the typical leap in the dark ends with a broken nose. Jimi got
lucky. So did Spielberg and Sydney.

However, for people such as CEOs and venture capitalists---and even
governments---what matters isn't the performance of any one project but
how a whole portfolio of projects performs. For them, it may be fine to
take big losses on 80 percent of projects as long as the gains from the
20 percent of projects that deliver Hirschman's happy
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_138 .pagebreak aria-label="138"
role="doc-pagebreak"}ending are so big that they more than compensate
for the losses. So I checked the data and found that the results were
equally clear: Losses far exceeded gains. Whether it's the average
project or a portfolio of projects, Hirschman's argument just doesn't
hold up.

These conclusions are overwhelmingly supported by logic and evidence,
including the main findings of Daniel Kahneman and behavioral science.
Simply put, if Kahneman is right, Hirschman is wrong. Kahneman
identified optimism bias as "the most significant of the cognitive
biases."^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_201){#chapter007.xhtml_not_201}^ An
optimistic benefit estimate is clearly an overestimate, which is the
prediction of Kahneman and behavioral science for project planning. But
Hirschman and the Hiding Hand predict the exact opposite, as we saw
earlier: underestimated benefits. So it's a clear-cut case of which of
the two opposite predictions is supported by the data. And the verdict
comes down overwhelmingly in favor of Kahneman and behavioral science
and against Hirschman and the Hiding Hand.

I know this conclusion is not emotionally satisfying. How could it be?
The rare exceptions Hirschman incorrectly thought are typical are,
almost by definition, fantastic projects that make irresistible stories.
They follow the perfect Hero's Journey, with a narrative arc from great
promise to near ruin to an even greater accomplishment and
celebration.^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_202){#chapter007.xhtml_not_202}^ We
seem hardwired to love such stories. We crave them in all cultures and
times. So there will always be authors telling those stories. Like
Hirschman. Or Malcolm Gladwell.

In the presence of such glory, who gives a damn about statistics?

### [THE REAL HERO'S JOURNEY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Some years ago, I gave a lecture about big projects in Sydney's
beautiful Aurora Place skyscraper, designed by one of my favorite
architects, Renzo Piano, to correspond spatially with the elegant curves
of the opera house, which it overlooks. After I spoke, someone in the
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_139 .pagebreak aria-label="139"
role="doc-pagebreak"}audience made exactly that point. "No one cares
about the costs," he said, waving to the opera house shells below. "Just
build." I nodded. I'd heard this sentiment many times.

"The genius who designed the opera house was a fellow Dane," I answered.
"His name was Jørn Utzon. He was young when he won the commission, in
his thirties. He died at the age of ninety. Can you name any other
building he designed during his long lifetime?"

Silence.

"There's a reason for that. The government here mismanaged the planning
and construction of the Sydney Opera House so badly that the costs and
schedule exploded. Little of that was Utzon's fault. But he was the
architect, so he was blamed and fired midconstruction. He left Australia
in secret and in disgrace. His reputation was ruined. Instead of being
showered with commissions to build more masterpieces, Utzon was
marginalized and forgotten. He became what no masterbuilder wants to be
or deserves to be. He became a *one-building
architect.*^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_203){#chapter007.xhtml_not_203}^

"What you call the costs are not the full costs," I continued. "Yes, the
Sydney Opera House cost a large amount of money, far more than it should
have. But the full cost of that building includes all the other
architectural treasures that Jørn Utzon never built. Sydney got its
masterpiece, but cities around the world were robbed of theirs."

More silence.

There are always other costs---costs that never appear on any
spreadsheet---when a project spirals out of control. The simplest are
what economists call "opportunity costs": the money unnecessarily burned
by bad planning that could have been used to fund something else,
including other projects. How many triumphs and wonders has bad planning
stolen from us? We'll never know. But we do know that bad planning stole
the buildings Jørn Utzon would have designed just as surely as we know
that Jimi Hendrix's untimely death stole the music he would have
composed.

[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_140 .pagebreak aria-label="140"
role="doc-pagebreak"}My disagreement with Hirschman---and with my
interlocuter in Sydney---isn't just about dollars and cents and
statistics. There is so much else at stake, including people's lives and
life's work. This is part of the equation we need to get right to get
projects right. And we should be grateful when things work out, needless
to say, as we are for the Sydney Opera House and Electric Lady.

So yes, it *is* possible to take a leap in the dark and land gracefully.
If it happens, it will make for a wonderful story. But that happy ending
is highly unlikely, and sometimes it requires turning a blind eye to
major negative consequences, such as the tragic destruction of Utzon's
career. My data put the odds of having a benefit overrun that exceeds
the cost overrun, even if by only a little, at 20 percent. Contrast that
with the 80 percent probability of failure. It's a dangerous bet---and
an unnecessary one.

Good planning that sweeps away ignorance will indeed reveal difficulties
ahead, but that is no reason to quit and walk away. Hirschman was right
in saying that people are ingenious, but he was wrong to think we have
to be deep into the delivery of a project, with our backs against the
wall, to summon up that creativity.

Just look at Frank Gehry. He is a wildly creative architect, but
contrary to the ridiculous popular image of how he works---perfectly
captured by that episode of *The Simpsons*---his creative process is
slow, painstaking, and relentlessly iterative. This is true of his
planning, not when the project is under construction and problems arise.
In fact, Gehry plans meticulously precisely to avoid getting himself
into desperate situations that he has to invent his way out of. For him,
careful planning doesn't obstruct creativity; it enables it.

The same is true of the torrent of creativity that has poured out of
Pixar Animation Studios over the decades, as we saw in chapter 4. It
overwhelmingly emerges during planning. Pixar would have been out of
business long ago if it had relied on Hirschman's model.

We do not have to be desperate to be creative. Indeed, there's
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_141 .pagebreak aria-label="141"
role="doc-pagebreak"}reason to think that desperation may actually
*hinder* the imaginative moments that elevate a project to glory.
Psychologists have studied the effects of stress on creativity for
decades, and there is now a substantial literature showing that it has a
largely---though not entirely---negative effect. A 2010 meta-analysis of
seventy-six studies found that stress is particularly corrosive in two
circumstances: when we feel that the situation is mostly beyond our
control and when we feel that others are judging our competence. Now
imagine a project spiraling out of control. The very phrase "out of
control" tells you that the first condition is probably present for
those involved. And reputations are likely on the line, satisfying the
second condition. So a project in trouble is exactly the sort of
situation in which we can expect stress to hamper
creativity.^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_204){#chapter007.xhtml_not_204}^

Imaginative leaps belong in planning, not delivery. When stakes and
stress are low, we are freer to wonder, try, and experiment. Planning is
creativity's natural habitat.

### [A STORY SUPPORTED BY DATA]{.sans} {.author-head1}

John Storyk understands this as well as anybody. When Jimi Hendrix
decided that a twenty-two-year-old who had never seen the inside of a
recording studio should design Electric Lady, he instantly made Storyk
famous in music circles. Storyk was given two more commissions to design
studios before he had even finished Electric Lady, and a career was
accidentally born. Whereas Eddie Kramer went on to become a legendary
rock producer, John Storyk became one of the world's premier designers
of studios and acoustics. His firm, the Walters-Storyk Design Group, has
worked everywhere from Lincoln Center in New York to the Swiss
Parliament Building to the National Museum of Qatar.

Storyk was seventy-four and still hard at work when we spoke and he
recalled the unforgettable start of his career. Not surprisingly,
[]{#chapter007.xhtml_Page_142 .pagebreak aria-label="142"
role="doc-pagebreak"}given how his big break came about, he's a believer
in serendipity and often uses the word. It's an open, smiling philosophy
of life. But today he doesn't rely on happy accidents to make his
projects successful. He plans carefully. And that means slowly.
Everybody wants things done yesterday, but "what I'm constantly trying
to do is slow things down," he says. Take time to develop ideas. Take
time to spot and correct problems. Do it on the drafting table, not the
construction site. "If you slow things down sometimes and you take a
second and a third look, you end up making less mistakes," he says. "And
that means \[the project gets done\] faster."

Storyk's career may have started with a leap in the dark that fit Albert
Hirschman's story. But his half century of successful projects around
the world is testament to the approach I advocated in the previous
chapters: Think slow, act fast. And *that* is supported by data.

So yes, all that slow thinking and the thoroughly detailed and tested
plan it produces is a good idea. But not even a superb plan delivers
itself. To take the final, critical step, you need a team---a single,
determined organism---to act fast and deliver on time.

In the next chapter, I'll show you how to forge one.

[]{#chapter008.xhtml}

## []{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_143 .pagebreak aria-label="143" role="doc-pagebreak"}**8** {.chapter-number}

![line image](images/img_005.jpg)

## A SINGLE, DETERMINED ORGANISM {.chapter-title}

::: ext2
*As important as it is to do the slow thinking that produces excellent
planning and forecasting, acting fast in delivery takes more than a
strong plan; you need an equally strong team. How are diverse people and
organizations with different identities and interests turned into a
single "us"---a team---with everyone rowing in the same direction:
toward delivery?*
:::

After the goal of the project has been decided and placed in the box on
the right.

After the plan has been developed using experiments, simulations, and
experience.

After accurate forecasts have been made, and risks mitigated, based on
real-world performance of past projects.

After all that, you have done your slow thinking and you have a plan
worthy of the name.

Now it's time to act fast and deliver.

A strong plan greatly increases the probability of a swift and
successful delivery. But it's not enough. As any experienced project
manager will tell you, you also need a capable, determined delivery
team. The success of any project depends on getting the team
right---"getting the right people on the bus," as one colleague
metaphorically put it, "and placing them in the right seats," as another
added.

I know a highly sought-after manager of multibillion-dollar IT
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_144 .pagebreak aria-label="144"
role="doc-pagebreak"}projects. He's the sort of person who is brought in
when everything is going wrong and executives know their careers are on
the line, which happens all too often with IT projects. His condition
for tackling any project? That he can bring his own team. That's how he
gets the team right. They are a tried and tested delivery force, which
makes them worth every penny of the many dollars spent to hire them.

Examine any successful project, and you're likely to find a team like
that. Frank Gehry's many successes---on time, on budget, with the vision
the client wants---have depended not only on Gehry but also on the
superb people who have worked with him for years; in some cases,
decades. The Empire State Building had excellent planning, as we have
seen, but it also had a construction firm renowned for putting up
skyscrapers fast.

Then there's the Hoover Dam. A soaring structure that awes tourists as
much today as it did when it was finished in 1936, the Hoover Dam was a
gigantic project built in what was a remote, dusty, dangerous location.
Yet it came in under budget and ahead of schedule. In the annals of big
projects, it is a legend. In large part, that triumph was owed to Frank
Crowe, the engineer who managed the project. Before tackling the Hoover
Dam, Crowe had spent a long career building dams across the western
United States and over those many years had developed a large and loyal
team that followed him from project to project. The experience contained
within that team was profound. So were the mutual trust, respect, and
understanding.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_205){#chapter008.xhtml_not_205}^

The value of experienced teams cannot be overstated, yet it is routinely
disregarded. A Canadian hydroelectric dam I consulted on is one of
countless examples. It went ahead under the direction of executives who
had zero experience with hydroelectric dams. Why? Because executives
*with* experience were difficult to find. How hard can it be to deliver
a big project?, the owners pondered. The oil and gas industry delivers
big projects. A hydroelectric dam is a big project. Ergo, executives
from oil and gas companies should be able to deliver
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_145 .pagebreak aria-label="145"
role="doc-pagebreak"}a dam. Or so the owners reasoned---and hired oil
and gas executives to build the dam. The reader will not be surprised to
learn that in sharp contrast to the Hoover Dam, this project turned into
a fiasco that threatened the economy of a whole province. That was when
I was brought in to diagnose the problem---too
late.^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_206){#chapter008.xhtml_not_206}^

So how do you get the team right? The simple solution, whenever
possible, is to hire the equivalent of Frank Crowe and his team or Gehry
and his. If they exist, get them. Even if they are expensive---which
they are not if you consider how much they will save you in cost, time,
and reputational damage. And don't wait until things have gone wrong;
hire them up front.

Unfortunately, sometimes such teams don't exist. Or if they do, they're
already engaged elsewhere. When a team cannot be hired, it must be
created. That's a common situation, and it was the challenge facing the
British Airports Authority (BAA) in 2001, when it announced that it
would build a new multibillion-dollar terminal at London's Heathrow
Airport.

### [A DEADLINE SET IN STONE]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Heathrow was, and is, one of the world's busiest airports, and the new
terminal---Terminal 5 (T5)---would be an immense addition. The main
building would be the largest freestanding structure in the United
Kingdom. Add two more buildings, and T5 would have fifty-three gates and
a total footprint of 3.8 million square feet. When we think of airports,
we imagine runways and large buildings like these. In reality, however,
airports are complex agglomerations of infrastructure and services, like
little cities. So T5 also required a long list of other
systems---tunnels, roads, parking facilities, rail connections,
stations, electronic systems, baggage handling, catering, safety
systems, and a new air traffic control tower for the whole
airport---that had to work together seamlessly.

[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_146 .pagebreak aria-label="146"
role="doc-pagebreak"}All that would be built between two runways with
the existing central terminal area at one end and a busy freeway at the
other. And the airport could never shut down. The whole project had to
be built without interrupting Heathrow's hectic operations for even a
minute. Apparently that wasn't enough pressure for BAA, a private
company that ran most of the major airports in the United Kingdom, so in
2001 it announced that, after many years of planning, construction of T5
would begin the following year and the project would be completed in six
and a half years. T5 would open on March 30, 2008. At 4:00
[A.M]{.small}., to be precise. "That meant at four in the morning, the
coffee had to be hot, the food available, and the gates ready," recalled
Andrew Wolstenholme, the BAA executive and engineer who oversaw the
construction of
T5.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_207){#chapter008.xhtml_not_207}^

To publicly declare the opening date of such an enormous project so
early was ambitious, to say the least. Some would say foolhardy;
certainly unusual. Heathrow was badly congested, with tens of millions
of weary passengers dragging luggage through its crowded, rundown halls,
and the need for a new terminal had been settled a decade and a half
earlier. But it had taken ages to make progress, in part due to
opposition in the communities around the airport and the longest round
of public consultations in British history. Up to the point when BAA
made its announcement, everything about T5 had been ponderous.

Further ratcheting up the pressure, BAA examined major UK construction
projects and international airport projects, using something like the
reference-class forecasting approach described in chapter 6, and
concluded that if T5 merely delivered typical results, it would come in
one year late and \$1 billion over budget---a result that could sink the
company.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_208){#chapter008.xhtml_not_208}^ The word
*deadline* comes from the American Civil War, when prison camps set
boundaries and any prisoner who crossed a line was
shot.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_209){#chapter008.xhtml_not_209}^ For BAA,
the metaphor fit uncomfortably well.

[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_147 .pagebreak aria-label="147"
role="doc-pagebreak"}To succeed, the delivery of T5 had to far
outperform the norm. BAA had three key strategies for making that
happen.

The first was planning. In line with what I called "Pixar planning" in
chapter 4, T5 was planned using highly detailed digital representations
that were used to run rigorous simulations. T5's creation and operation
worked on computers before they were attempted in reality.

Digital simulation enabled the second strategy: a radically different
approach to construction. Instead of sending materials to a worksite to
be measured, cut, shaped, and welded into buildings---the conventional
way since the building of the pyramids---the materials were sent to
factories, which used the detailed, precise digital specifications sent
to them to manufacture components. Then the components were sent to the
worksite to be assembled. To the untrained eye, T5 would have looked
like a conventional construction site, but it wasn't; it was an
*assembly* site.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_210){#chapter008.xhtml_not_210}^
The importance of this difference cannot be overstated, and every large
construction site will need to follow suit if construction is going to
make it into the twenty-first century. This process, called "design for
manufacture and assembly," is how the hyperefficient car industry
operates. Sir John Egan, the CEO of BAA and a former head of Jaguar, had
argued in an influential report to the UK government that this approach
would produce major efficiency gains in
construction.^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_211){#chapter008.xhtml_not_211}^
With T5, he put his thinking into practice.

The third strategy was all about people. We perform at our best when we
feel united, empowered, and mutually committed to accomplishing
something worthwhile. Much psychological and organizational research
tells us so.^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_212){#chapter008.xhtml_not_212}^ It's
also common sense. There's a word to describe a group of people who feel
that way: they are a team. That was what T5's workforce had to become,
Wolstenholme and other BAA executives knew, if the project was to have
any chance of succeeding. They also knew what a tall order that was. T5
would be built by thousands of people, from executives and lawyers to
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_148 .pagebreak aria-label="148"
role="doc-pagebreak"}engineers, surveyors, accountants, designers,
electricians, plumbers, carpenters, welders, glaziers, drywallers,
drivers, pipefitters, landscapers, cooks, and many others. They would be
white collar and blue collar, management and union. They would come from
different organizations with different cultures and interests. Yet
somehow this fractious bunch would have to become a coordinated,
purposeful, creative whole.

From the outset, Wolstenholme led a deliberate campaign to make that
happen. "Our approach wasn't for the faint-hearted," he says. "You have
to have very strong leaders who don't just understand the what but the
how."

### [HOW TO BUILD A TEAM]{.sans} {.author-head1}

The first "how" was BAA's decision to do much more than hire firms and
oversee their work. It would actively lead and share risks. That meant
getting involved in disputes as early as possible.

Richard Harper is a construction supervisor who spent four and a half
years at T5, directing the hundreds of workers erecting the steel frames
of the main terminal and other buildings. In the early stages of the
project, Harper's steel company had to work behind one of BAA's
principal contractors, a major British engineering firm that was pouring
concrete. Harper warned BAA that the principal contractor wouldn't be
able to work fast enough to stay ahead of him, which would result in his
crew being "stood"---workers and equipment standing around waiting, a
costly sin in construction. If that happened, Harper's company would
take the financial hit because its contract with BAA called for it to be
paid a flat fee. Despite assurances from the principal contractor that
it wouldn't fall behind, it did. The owner of Harper's company was
furious, and the two companies argued about who was to blame.

"BAA could see there was trouble looming," Harper recalled in the
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_149 .pagebreak aria-label="149"
role="doc-pagebreak"}"Brummie" accent of his native Birmingham. His
company could sue the principal contractor. Or worse. The owner of
Harper's company "was very short fused. He could very easily have walked
away from the project, which he'd done many times \[on other
projects\]."^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_213){#chapter008.xhtml_not_213}^

BAA intervened. It changed its contract with Harper's company to a
cost-reimbursable arrangement with a percentage profit on top when
milestones were met. With that revised incentive structure BAA defused
the conflict. No longer required to protect their separate
self-interests, Harper's company and the principal contractor stopped
pointing fingers at each other and instead discussed how best to tackle
the problem. The principal contractor agreed to bring in hundreds more
workers. Harper's company agreed to shuffle workers to other jobs while
the principal contractor caught up. A conflict that could have turned
into a meltdown quickly cooled, and the project rolled along.

Contracts such as that between BAA and Harper's company became a
hallmark of the project, meaning that BAA assumed far more risk than it
would have under ordinary contracts. But by giving companies only
positive incentives to perform well---including bonuses for meeting and
beating benchmarks---it ensured that the interests of the many different
companies working on the project were not pitted against one another.
Instead, everyone had the same interest: completing T5 on
time.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_214){#chapter008.xhtml_not_214}^ With their
interests aligned, cooperation between Harper's company and the
principal contractor flourished. At one point, the principal
contractor's work made it impossible for Harper to operate his cranes.
Rather than fight about it or complain to BAA, the two companies'
executives sat down, explored solutions, and agreed that building a
temporary ramp would enable both companies to keep working
simultaneously. The principal contractor quickly built the ramp---and
paid for it. "It must have cost, at a minimum, £100,000," Harper said.
The project kept rolling.

[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_150 .pagebreak aria-label="150"
role="doc-pagebreak"}It helped that many of the managers of the various
companies knew one another. "We'd all worked together on sites in London
and around England and Wales," said Harper, who, like most of his
colleagues, had already had decades of experience when he arrived at T5.
"So there was a good rapport there in the first place." That was also by
design. BAA understood, as so many others do not, that "lowest bid" does
not necessarily mean "lowest cost," so rather than follow the common
practice of hiring the lowest bidders, BAA stuck with companies it had
worked with for years and that had proven their ability to deliver what
BAA needed. And it encouraged those companies to do the same with
specialized subcontractors---experience again.

"If you're going to win a football game, you need to play with the same
squad every season," Andrew Wolstenholme said, using an impeccably
British metaphor. "We'd built up trust. We understood each other."

But when you work on a joint project with people from many companies,
which squad are you playing for? Who are your teammates? Teams are
identities. To truly be on one, people must know it. So BAA gave
everyone working on T5, including its own employees, a clear and
emphatic answer: Forget how things are usually done on big projects.
Your team is not your company. Here, your team is T5. We are *one* team.

Wolstenholme is an engineer with decades of experience in construction,
but he started his career in the British military, where the squad you
play for is literally on your forehead---in the form of your unit's "cap
badge." When people came to T5, Wolstenholme says, they were told, "Take
off your cap badge and throw it away, because you work for T5."

That message was explicit, blunt, and repeated. "We had posters on the
walls of people with lightbulbs going on, and they were saying, you
know, 'I get it. I work for T5.'"

### []{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_151 .pagebreak aria-label="151" role="doc-pagebreak"}[MAKING HISTORY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Identity was the first step. Purpose was the second. It had to *matter*
that you worked for T5. To that end, the worksite was plastered with
posters and other promotions comparing T5 with great projects of the
past: the partially completed Eiffel Tower in Paris; Grand Central
Terminal under construction in New York; the massive Thames Barrier
flood controls in London. Each appeared on posters with the caption
"We're making history, too." When important stages of T5 were completed,
such as the installation of the new air traffic control tower, they went
up alongside the Eiffel Tower and all the rest. "One day," the posters
promised, "you'll be proud to say, 'I built T5.'"

"The whole philosophy," Andrew Wolstenholme recalled, was to "share the
culture right from the top to the person sweeping the dust off the
runway or finishing off the concrete or putting the tiles on the floor.
They had to feel equally part of what we're building, that we're making
history here in delivering T5."

I grew up in construction and know from firsthand experience that
construction workers are sharp as knives at understanding what's
happening on their worksites. Moreover, they have a well-founded
skepticism of management. They know corporate propaganda when they see
it, and they distrust it. "Most guys turn up with cynicism on any site
we go to," Richard Harper said. They are usually right to be cynical
"because it's all bollocks what the people \[management\] are saying."
Promises aren't kept. Work conditions are poor. Workers aren't listened
to. When reality doesn't match the words, corporate PR about teamwork
and making history is worse than useless on the shop floor.

The workers brought their usual cynicism to T5, Harper said. "But with
that site, within, if not forty-eight hours, a week maximum, everybody
had bought into the philosophy of T5. Because they could see T5 was
implementing what they said they would do."

[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_152 .pagebreak aria-label="152"
role="doc-pagebreak"}It started with the on-site facilities. "It was
just something mind-boggling," Harper told me, sounding amazed even now.
"The guys had never seen this. The toilets, the showers, the canteens
were the best I've ever seen on any site I've worked on in the world.
They were fantastic."

BAA ensured that whatever workers needed, they got, right away,
particularly when it involved safety. "All the PPE \[personal protective
equipment\] was provided," Harper said. "If guys had wet gloves, they
only had to take them back to the store and they got a fresh pair of
gloves. If they had a scratch on the glasses and couldn't see properly,
they'd take the glasses back, and they were changed. Guys weren't used
to this. This was totally new to them. On other jobs, they told you, 'If
you're not happy with the glasses or whatever, buy your own.'" These may
sound like small things to outsiders, but as Harper pointed out, for
workers they are "massive, just massive. You set a man to work in the
morning and you've put the things there that he wants, then you get a
good day's work. You start them off in a bad way, and you know the next
eight to ten hours, it's going to be very difficult." Multiply that by
thousands of workers and thousands of days, and you do indeed get
something massive.

T5's managers not only listened to workers, they consulted them, asking
some to sit down with designers to explore how designs and workflows
could be improved. Once the standards for finished work were agreed
upon, skilled workers developed their own system of benchmarks to
establish the quality of workmanship required for both themselves and
everyone else to follow. Some 1,400 of these samples were photographed,
cataloged, and put on display at the worksite. Because the benchmarks
came from the workers, the workers took ownership of them, increasing
the effectiveness of implementation.

With a shared sense of identity, purpose, and standards, open
communication is easier, but BAA further cultivated the feeling that
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_153 .pagebreak aria-label="153"
role="doc-pagebreak"}everyone on the project had both a right and a
responsibility to speak up. Everyone knew "you had the backing of BAA"
if you wanted to say something, Harper said. "If any of the guys had
ideas, you know, 'I think we could do this or that,' you were free to
say it. If anybody felt aggrieved about something, you were free to say
that as well."

Harvard professor Amy Edmondson dubbed this sense of being free to speak
your mind "psychological safety." It's hard to overstate its value.
Psychological safety boosts morale, fosters improvements, and ensures
that, in Andrew Wolstenholme's words, "bad news travels fast"---so
problems can be tackled
quickly.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_215){#chapter008.xhtml_not_215}^

### [4:00 [A.M]{.small}.]{.sans} {.author-head1}

It worked. "I'm sixty years old. I've been in construction since I was
fifteen," said Harper, who has worked across the United Kingdom and in
countries around the world. "I have never, ever seen that level of
cooperation."

From the suits to the hard hats, the spirit was the same. "There wasn't
one man came to me and said anything detrimental about T5. Everybody had
nothing but praise. What a great job it was. How the management and
workers on-site worked together. No shouting, no screaming. Everybody
happy."The most telling evidence, Harper told me, was the shirts and
jackets emblazoned with the project logo. All big construction projects
hand them out to workers, but they're seldom worn anywhere but on the
worksite. "The job I'm at now, the guys can't wait to get them off. They
hate the contractor." To Harper's amazement, workers wore T5 gear the
way passionate soccer fans wear their team's jersey. "The guys used to
go straight to the pub from work and still have 'em on! They were proud
to be part of a project like that."

T5 finished on budget and on time. And at precisely 4:00 [A.M]{.small}.
on March 27, 2008---the date had been moved up three days---the new
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_154 .pagebreak aria-label="154"
role="doc-pagebreak"}terminal opened. The coffee was indeed hot. The
project wasn't perfect, to be sure. Problems with baggage distribution
systems in the first several days forced British Airways to cancel
flights, which was embarrassing and expensive, but the kinks were worked
out and the terminal operated well within a few months---and has done so
ever since. In an annual survey of global travelers, T5 routinely ranks
among the world's favorite terminals. It took the top spot six times in
its first eleven years of
operation.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_216){#chapter008.xhtml_not_216}^

Success didn't come cheaply. "We spent quite a lot of money on
developing the team dynamics," Andrew Wolstenholme said. BAA also put a
lot of time and effort into it. Plus, it shouldered more direct
financial risk. But if the delivery had merely been average, the
deadline would have been missed and the cost overrun could easily have
run into billions of pounds. That made the money spent on getting the
team right a stellar investment.

That lesson was driven home by another giant project that,
coincidentally, was under way elsewhere in London. The original Wembley
Stadium was the most famous soccer stadium in the world and something of
a national shrine until it was demolished in 2002 to make way for a new
stadium. If ever there was a project that could inspire teamwork, it
would surely be the construction of the new home of Britain's national
sport. Yet nothing remotely like the T5 spirit of shared purpose and
"making history" emerged at Wembley; quite the opposite. It was a
project rife with conflicts. Work stoppages were routine. "The guys
there had no pride in constructing our national stadium," said Richard
Harper. Inevitably, the project dragged on years past its deadline,
forcing the Football Association (FA) Cup Final and other events to be
moved. The cost, according to *The Guardian,* doubled from a forecast
£445 million to £900 million (US \$1.2 billion). Inevitably, it spawned
a massive
lawsuit.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_217){#chapter008.xhtml_not_217}^

T5 is an unlikely object of affection. It's just an airport terminal,
after all. Yet the workers who built T5 were so committed to the
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_155 .pagebreak aria-label="155"
role="doc-pagebreak"}project that when it was done and they all put
their cap badges back on and left, "people sort of found it quite
difficult to go back," Wolstenholme observed.

Thirteen years had passed since T5's completion when I spoke with
Richard Harper, but the wistfulness in his voice was unmistakable. "I
loved it," he said.

### [THE SECRET TO SCALING UP]{.sans} {.author-head1}

When your team has delivered your project on time, on budget, with the
expected benefits, it's time to pop the champagne and celebrate. So you
may think that this is the end of the book. But I can't stop yet because
I still haven't told you the solution to the puzzle I mentioned in the
first chapter.

You will recall that most project types are not only at risk of coming
in late, going over budget, and generating fewer benefits than expected.
They are at risk of going *disastrously* wrong. That means you may not
wind up 10 percent over budget; you may go 100 percent over. Or 400
percent. Or worse. These are black swan outcomes, and the project types
at risk of them are called "fat-tailed." They include nuclear power
plants, hydroelectric dams, information technology, tunnels, major
buildings, aerospace, and many more. In fact, almost all the project
types in my database are fat-tailed. But not quite all.

There are five project types that are not fat-tailed. That means they
may come in somewhat late or over budget but it's very unlikely that
they will go *disastrously* wrong. The fortunate five? They are solar
power, wind power, fossil thermal power (power plants that generate
electricity by burning fossil fuels), electricity transmission, and
roads. In fact, the best-performing project types in my entire database,
by a comfortable margin, are wind and solar power.

So this is the puzzle: Why are these project types exceptional? What
makes them a safer bet than all the rest? And why are wind and
[]{#chapter008.xhtml_Page_156 .pagebreak aria-label="156"
role="doc-pagebreak"}solar power the most reliable projects of all, more
likely than any other project type to be delivered successfully?

I'll provide the illuminating answer in the next and final chapter. And
I'll assemble the ideas from earlier chapters into a model that anyone
can use to lower cost and improve quality for projects at all scales,
from wedding cakes and kitchen renovations to subways and satellites.

But for projects that have to scale up---*way up*---this model is more
than valuable; it is essential. With this model, truly huge projects can
be carried out at far less cost and risk far more quickly and reliably.
We can build at colossal scale with higher quality and accelerated
speed, saving sums of money substantial enough to change the fortunes of
companies, industries, and countries.

This model could even help save us from climate change.

*Get a small thing, a basic building block. Combine it with another and

becomes a solar panel, which becomes a solar array, which becomes a
massive megawatt-churning solar farm. Modularity delivers faster,

But for building at a truly huge scale---the scale that transforms
cities, countries, even the world---modularity is not just valuable,
it's indispensable.*

In 1983, the government of Japan launched a new project that was as
promising as it was enormous. Its name was Monju, meaning "wisdom." When
completed, Monju would be both a nuclear power plant churning out
electricity for consumers and a fast-breeder reactor, a new type of
nuclear plant that would produce fuel for the nuclear industry. For a
nation long threatened by energy insecurity, Monju was designed to
deliver a better
future.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_218){#chapter009.xhtml_not_218}^

Construction started in 1986. It finished almost a decade later, in
1995. But a fire immediately shut down the facility. An attempt to cover
up the accident became a political scandal that kept the plant closed
for years.^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_219){#chapter009.xhtml_not_219}^

In 2000, the Japan Atomic Energy Agency announced that the plant could
restart. Japan's supreme court finally authorized the restart in 2005.
Operations were scheduled to begin in 2008, but they were
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_158 .pagebreak aria-label="158"
role="doc-pagebreak"}postponed until 2009. Test runs started in 2010,
with full operations scheduled to commence, for the first time, in 2013.
But in May 2013, maintenance flaws were discovered on some fourteen
thousand components of the plant, including critical safety equipment.
The restart was halted. Further violations of safety protocols were
uncovered. Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority declared Monju's
operator to be
unqualified.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_220){#chapter009.xhtml_not_220}^ At
that point, the government had spent \$12 billion and the estimated cost
of finally restarting Monju and operating it for ten years was another
\$6 billion---at a time when the 2011 Fukushima disaster had turned
popular opinion against nuclear power. The government finally threw in
the towel. In 2016, it announced that Monju would be permanently
closed.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_221){#chapter009.xhtml_not_221}^

Decommissioning Monju is expected to take another thirty years and cost
a further \$3.4 billion. If that forecast proves more accurate than the
rest, the project will have taken sixty years, cost more than \$15
billion, and produced zero
electricity.^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_222){#chapter009.xhtml_not_222}^

Monju is an extreme case, but it's not in a category by itself. Far from
it. Nuclear power plants are one of the worst-performing project types
in my database, with an average cost overrun of 120 percent in real
terms and schedules running 65 percent longer than planned. Even worse,
they are at risk of fat-tail extremes for both cost and schedule,
meaning they may go 20 or 30 percent over budget. Or 200 or 300 percent.
Or 500 percent. Or more. There is almost no limit to how bad things can
get, as Monju demonstrated so
spectacularly.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_223){#chapter009.xhtml_not_223}^

The problem isn't nuclear power; many other project types have track
records only somewhat less bad. The problem lies in the way huge
projects like Monju are typically designed and delivered. When we
understand that problem, we will find a solution to building big that
is, paradoxically, small. In fact, it is tiny, like a single block of
Lego. But it's remarkable what you can do with blocks of Lego, as we
will see.

### []{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_159 .pagebreak aria-label="159" role="doc-pagebreak"}[ONE HUGE THING]{.sans} {.author-head1}

One way to design and deliver a project on an enormous scale is to build
one thing. One *huge* thing.

Monju is one huge thing. Most nuclear power plants are. So are giant
hydroelectric dams, high-speed rail lines such as that in California,
and mammoth IT projects and skyscrapers.

If you build like this, you build only one thing. By definition, that
thing is one of a kind. To put that in the language of tailors, it is
bespoke: no standard parts, no commercial off-the-shelf products, no
simple repetition of what was done last time. And that translates into
slow and complex. Nuclear power plants, for one, are the products of a
staggering number of bespoke parts and systems that must all work, and
work together, for the plant as a whole to work.

Complex bespokeness alone makes huge projects hard to deliver if done in
this manner. But that is compounded by several more factors.

First, you can't build a nuclear power plant quickly, run it for a
while, see what works and what doesn't, then change the design to
incorporate the lessons learned. It's too expensive and dangerous. That
means that experimentation---one-half of the *experiri* I discussed in
chapter 4---is out. You have no choice but to get it right the first
time.

Second, there's a problem with experience---the other half of
*experiri.* If you are building a nuclear power plant, chances are that
you haven't done much of that before for the simple reason that few have
been built and each takes many years to complete, so opportunities to
develop experience are scarce. Yet with no experimentation and little
experience, you still have to get it exactly right the first time.
That's difficult, if not impossible.

Even if you do have some experience building nuclear power plants, you
probably won't have experience building this *particular* nuclear
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_160 .pagebreak aria-label="160"
role="doc-pagebreak"}plant because, with few exceptions, each plant is
specifically designed for a specific site, with technology that changes
over time. Like Monju, it is bespoke, one of a kind. Anything bespoke is
expensive and slow to make, like a tailored suit. But imagine a tailor
who has little experience with suits making a bespoke suit for you and
having to get it right on the first try. It's not going to end well. And
that's just a suit, not a multibillion-dollar, fantastically complex
nuclear power plant.

Lacking experimentation and experience, what you learn as you proceed is
that the project is more difficult and costly than you expected---and
not just the single project you're doing but the project type as such.
Obstacles that were unknown are encountered. Solutions thought to work
don't. And you cannot make up for it by tinkering or starting over with
revised plans. Operations experts call this "negative learning": The
more you learn, the more difficult and costly it gets.

Third, there's the financial strain. A nuclear power plant must be
completely finished before it can generate any electricity. Even
ninetenths done, it's useless. So all the money that is poured into the
plant produces nothing for the entire time it takes you to get to the
ribboncutting ceremony---which, given the bespokeness, the complexity,
the lack of experimentation, your lack of experience, the negative
learning, and the need to get everything right the first time, will
probably be a very long time. All this is reflected in the dreadful
performance data for nuclear power plants.

Finally, don't forget black swans. All projects are vulnerable to
unpredictable shocks, with their vulnerability growing as time passes.
So the fact that the delivery of your one huge thing will take a very
long time means that it is at high risk of being walloped by something
you cannot possibly anticipate.That's exactly what happened to Monju.
More than a quarter century after the project was launched, when the
plant was still not ready to go, an earthquake caused a tsunami that
struck the nuclear plant at Fukushima, producing the disaster that
turned public opinion against nuclear power and finally convinced the
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_161 .pagebreak aria-label="161"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Japanese government to pull the plug on Monju. It
is a giant understatement to say that that turn of events could not have
been predicted in 1983. But when delivery takes decades, the
unpredictable becomes inevitable.

Add up all this, and it's not remarkable that nuclear power plants and
other "one huge thing" projects are painfully slow and expensive to
deliver. It's remarkable that they are delivered at all. Fortunately,
there is another way to build huge things.

### [MANY SMALL THINGS]{.sans} {.author-head1}

At the beginning of this book, I mentioned a project that successfully
delivered twenty thousand schools and classrooms to Nepal, which I
designed, planned, and programmed with the architect Hans Lauritz
Jørgensen.

There are two ways of looking at that project. Viewed one way, it was
huge. After all, we built a major part of an entire national school
system. But another way of looking at it is to focus on the classroom.
In some instances, a single classroom was the whole school. In others,
putting a couple of classrooms together made a school. In still others,
three or more classrooms made a school. Assemble enough classrooms into
enough schools, and you have the schools for a district. Do that for all
districts, and you have a national school system.

A classroom is small, however many there are. So you could say that our
project was small.

Small is good. For one thing, small projects can be simple. That's what
Jørgensen and I aimed for from the outset. We wanted the schools to be
functional, high quality, and earthquake proof. But within those
parameters, they would be as simple as possible. That's why we decided,
for example, that there would be only three main school designs, with
the slope at the construction site---Nepal is extremely
mountainous---the main variable.

[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_162 .pagebreak aria-label="162"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The Nepalese government had emphasized that the
schools were desperately needed, so we accelerated the program in every
way. It took us only a few weeks to develop the first draft of the basic
designs and construction program. Raising funds and final decisions took
a few months. Then construction of the first schools
began.^[7](#notes.xhtml#note_224){#chapter009.xhtml_not_224}^

It's relatively easy to build something small and simple. One classroom
went up quickly. And another. For the many village schools that had only
one or two classrooms, that was a complete school. For those that
required more classrooms, more were built. When a school was finished,
kids went to class and teachers started teaching. Experts assessed what
worked and what didn't. Changes were made. The next batch of classrooms
and schools got going. And the next.

Repeat this process over and over and over, and you have the whole story
of the project. A number of classrooms becomes a school. A number of
schools completes a district. A number of districts becomes a major new
addition to a national school system in which hundreds of thousands of
students are learning. That's a huge thing made of many small things.

There is, however, a big difference between this huge thing and those
built as "one huge thing": The schools in Nepal were delivered on budget
and years ahead of schedule. And they worked well, according to
independent
evaluations.^[8](#notes.xhtml#note_225){#chapter009.xhtml_not_225}^

*Modularity* is a clunky word for the elegant idea of big things made
from small things. A block of Lego is a small thing, but by assembling
more than nine thousand of them, you can build one of the biggest sets
Lego makes, a scale model of the Colosseum in Rome. That's modularity.

Look for it in the world, and you'll see it everywhere. A brick wall is
made of hundreds of bricks. A flock of starlings, which moves as if it
were a unitary organism, may be composed of hundreds or thousands of
birds. Even our bodies are modular, composed of trillions of cells that
are themselves modular. There's an evolutionary reason for
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_163 .pagebreak aria-label="163"
role="doc-pagebreak"}this ubiquity: In survival of the fittest, the
"fittest" is often a module that is particularly successful in
reproducing
itself.^[9](#notes.xhtml#note_226){#chapter009.xhtml_not_226}^

The core of modularity is repetition. Put down one Lego block. Snap on
another. And another. And another. Repeat, repeat, repeat. Click, click,
click.

Repetition is the genius of modularity; it enables experimentation. If
something works, you keep it in the plan. If it doesn't, you "fail
fast," to use the famous Silicon Valley term, and adjust the plan. You
get smarter. Designs improve.

Repetition also generates experience, making your performance better.
This is called "positive learning," as we saw earlier. Repetition
rockets you up the learning curve, making each new iteration better,
easier, cheaper, and faster.

As the old Latin saying goes, "*Repetitio est mater
studiorum*"---"Repetition is the mother of learning." Yes, I wrote that
in chapter 4. But repetition is the mother of learning.

Wedding cakes are a wonderful illustration. Even the grandest wedding
cake is mostly composed of a series of identical, flat, ordinary cakes.
Stack several of those, and you get one tier. Bake more, stack them, and
you get another tier. Assemble many tiers, and you get a great tower of
cake. That sounds easy enough, but as many a baking enthusiast has
discovered, even if your individual cakes are baked correctly, your
first attempts to stack cakes are likely to produce something that looks
more like the Leaning Tower of Pisa than the magnificent monuments in
magazines. Bakers develop the ability to deliver perfect cakes only
after trying many times, learning a little lesson here, a little lesson
there. But because wedding cakes are so inherently modular and
repetitive, bakers who keep at it get that experience rapidly---and they
soon become highly skilled.

It's important to note that modularity is a matter of degree. The Empire
State Building wasn't modular to the extent that a Lego model of the
Empire State Building is modular, but its floors were
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_164 .pagebreak aria-label="164"
role="doc-pagebreak"}designed to be as similar as possible, with many
being identical, which meant that workers often repeated work, which
helped them learn and work faster. Similarly, the construction of the
Pentagon was accelerated by keeping the five sides of the building
identical. Following this line of reasoning, I advised a company
building a large nuclear power plant to duplicate exactly what it had
done in building a recent plant, not because the earlier plant had been
a great success but because even that degree of repetition would boost
them up the learning curve. Every little bit helps.

In Nepal, our Lego was the classroom, with schools and districts being
larger modules. So the project was very modular. But it could have been
even more so. Our schools were built the traditional way, with building
materials brought to the site and workers cutting, framing, laying,
mortaring, nailing, sanding, and finishing the materials to build
schools classroom by classroom. In other countries---it wasn't advisable
in Nepal for a variety of reasons---that work could instead be done in a
factory. The Lego that ships from the factory could be a complete
classroom if it is small enough to fit onto the back of a flatbed truck
and transported on the roads---if there are roads, which was not the
case for many mountain villages in Nepal. If the classroom is too big
for that, it could be built in chunks---half a classroom, perhaps, or
the components of a classroom---and shipped. When the modules are
delivered to the site, the building isn't constructed; it's assembled,
like Lego. In this way, the construction site morphs into an assembly
site, which is exactly what you want, as mentioned previously.

This is happening in England. Factories build half classrooms. Those
Lego are shipped to the site and assembled into a new school. "It
enabled us to be better and faster and indeed deliver higher quality,"
said Mike Green, the government official in charge of the program. It's
also a lot cheaper. "We have already knocked a third off the per square
meter cost of building schools," he told me, and he is
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_165 .pagebreak aria-label="165"
role="doc-pagebreak"}convinced that there are more savings to be
had.^[10](#notes.xhtml#note_227){#chapter009.xhtml_not_227}^ My data
confirm he is right.

Manufacturing in a factory and assembling on-site is far more efficient
than traditional construction because a factory is a controlled
environment designed to be as efficient, linear, and predictable as
possible. To take an obvious example, bad weather routinely wreaks havoc
on outdoor construction, while production in a factory proceeds
regardless of the elements. As I mentioned in the previous chapter, this
process---properly known as "design for manufacture and assembly"---is a
big part of the explanation of the success of Heathrow's Terminal 5.

When Lego shipped from factories is assembled, scaling up is mainly a
matter of adding more of the same. The best illustration is a facility
that few people have seen and fewer think about but that is
indispensable in our digital world: the server farm. The Lego is the
server. Stack a number of servers, and you get a rack. A number of racks
forms a row. A number of rows forms a room. A number of rooms forms a
building. A number of buildings, and you have a server farm. If you are
Apple, Microsoft, or some other large corporation that needs even more
server power, you build more farms. In principle, there's no limit to
the server capacity you can build in this manner, fast and at
ever-falling cost.

### [SCALE-FREE SCALABILITY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Notice that I'm not using precise numbers. That's because the numbers
can be scaled up or down as much as you like---from one to infinity and
back again---without changing the character of the whole, much the same
way that a flock of starlings is a flock of starlings and behaves like a
flock of starlings whether it is made of fifty birds, five hundred, or
five thousand. The technical term for this property is "scale free,"
meaning that the thing is basically the same no matter what size it is.
This gives you the magic of what I call "scale-free scalability,"
meaning []{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_166 .pagebreak aria-label="166"
role="doc-pagebreak"}you can scale up or down following the same
principles independently of where you are scalewise, which is exactly
what you want in order to build something huge with ease. The
mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot, who first laid out the science of
scale-free scalability, called this attribute "fractal"---like one of
those popular Internet memes in which you see a pattern, then zoom into
a detail within the pattern and discover that it looks the same as the
pattern as a whole, and you keep zooming in and keep discovering the
same pattern.^[11](#notes.xhtml#note_228){#chapter009.xhtml_not_228}^

Modularity can do astonishing things. When the Covid pandemic first
emerged in China in January 2020, a company that makes modular housing
modified an existing room design and cranked out units in a factory.
Nine days later, a thousand-bed hospital with fourteen hundred staff
opened in Wuhan, ground zero of the outbreak. Other, bigger hospitals
went up almost as
fast.^[12](#notes.xhtml#note_229){#chapter009.xhtml_not_229}^ Hong Kong
did something similar to build quarantine facilities, preparing a site
and assembling a thousand units of comfortable, fully equipped modern
housing in four months. When the government later decided that anyone
coming into Hong Kong would have to spend twenty-one days in quarantine,
the facility was quickly expanded to thirty-five hundred units with room
for seven thousand people. All the units can be disconnected and set up
elsewhere---or put into
storage.^[13](#notes.xhtml#note_230){#chapter009.xhtml_not_230}^

The obvious objection is that modules may be fine for emergencies and
utilities such as server farms, but they're cheap and ugly and aren't
suitable for anything more permanent and public. There's something to
that view. Much of what passed for modular housing in previous
generations was indeed cheap and ugly. But that doesn't mean it had to
be. Some modular housing was considerably better than that, notably
Sears Modern Homes. For much of the first half of the twentieth century,
Americans could open a Sears, Roebuck catalog, order a house, and have a
complete factory-built kit delivered. All the parts were included, with
instructions for assembly, like IKEA furniture on a grand scale. Sears
sold around seventy thousand kits. Many of the
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_167 .pagebreak aria-label="167"
role="doc-pagebreak"}buildings are still standing 90, 100, or 110 years
later and are prized for their high-quality construction and classic
design.^[14](#notes.xhtml#note_231){#chapter009.xhtml_not_231}^ And that
was a century ago. Modern information and manufacturing technology make
so much more possible, and easier, today.

When I spoke with Mike Green, he was working on an app that would allow
local officials and citizens in the United Kingdom to design their own
schools by dragging and dropping standard-sized classrooms and hallways.
"And when you press finish, it holds up a component list which can be
filed with a manufacturer instantly," he said. The goal is to make it
possible for a school to be ordered in much the same way a car
is.^[15](#notes.xhtml#note_232){#chapter009.xhtml_not_232}^ The
comparison is apt. Cars are extremely modular---even very expensive and
sophisticated cars are assembled Lego style---yet no one complains that
there are no aesthetically pleasing, high-quality cars. It is fully
possible for the words *modular, beautiful,* and *high quality* to
appear in the same sentence.

When the architect Danny Forster designed an elegant twentysix-story
Marriott hotel for a swanky street in Manhattan, he made it entirely
modular. Rooms were his Lego. Each was constructed in a factory in
Poland, complete with everything, even furniture, then shipped to a
warehouse in Brooklyn. The Covid pandemic interrupted the plan, but when
tourism rebounds and the numbers work again, the plan is that the rooms
will be taken out of storage and the world's largest and coolest modular
hotel will be assembled. "We want to demonstrate that modular building
can do more than just harness the efficiencies of the factory," Forster
said. "It can produce a graceful and iconic
tower."^[16](#notes.xhtml#note_233){#chapter009.xhtml_not_233}^

Even further removed from cheap and ugly is Apple's dazzling, ethereal
headquarters in Cupertino, California, designed by Norman Foster, Steve
Jobs, and Jony Ive, where modularity played a major role, too. As
conceived by Jobs, "This would be a workplace where people were open to
each other and open to nature, and the key to that would be modular
sections, known as pods, for work or []{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_168
.pagebreak aria-label="168" role="doc-pagebreak"}collaboration," the
journalist Steven Levy summarized. "Jobs' idea was to repeat those pods
over and over: pod for office work, pod for teamwork, pod for
socializing, like a piano roll playing a Philip Glass
composition."^[17](#notes.xhtml#note_234){#chapter009.xhtml_not_234}^
That extended to how the building was put together. "We viewed the
construction process as a manufacturing project and wanted to do as much
outside of here as possible," Apple's CEO Tim Cook told *Wired*
magazine. "Then you begin to put together Legos."

The difference between cheap-and-ugly modular and these projects is
imagination and technology. To fully unlock modularity's potential, to
see how astonishingly versatile it can be, we need to "think different,"
as the old Apple slogan put it.

### [PLAYING WITH LEGO]{.sans} {.author-head1}

What is our basic building block, the thing we will repeatedly make,
becoming smarter and better each time we do so? That's the question
every project leader should ask. What is the small thing we can assemble
in large numbers into a big thing? Or a huge thing? *What's our Lego?*
Explore that question, and you may be surprised by what you discover.

Consider a giant hydroelectric dam, for example. It may seem obvious
that there's no alternative. Either you dam the river, or you don't.
There's no role for modularity.

Except there is. You could divert some of the river's flow, run it
through small turbines to generate electricity, and return it to the
river. This is called "small-scale hydroelectric." An installation like
that is relatively tiny, and it produces only a fraction of the power of
a major dam. But treat it like Lego---repeat, repeat, repeat---and you
will get substantial electricity production with less environmental
damage, less citizen protest, less cost, and less risk. One of the
world's leaders in hydroelectricity, Norway, a country of just 5 million
inhabitants, has an active policy to enhance small hydro development and
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_169 .pagebreak aria-label="169"
role="doc-pagebreak"}has commissioned more than 350 small-scale
hydroelectric projects since 2003, with more to
come.^[18](#notes.xhtml#note_235){#chapter009.xhtml_not_235}^

A giant factory, too, may seem to be one huge thing or nothing. But when
Elon Musk announced that Tesla would build Gigafactory 1 (today known as
Giga Nevada), the world's largest factory by footprint, he envisioned it
in modular terms. His Lego was a small factory. Build one, get it
working. Build another beside it and integrate the two. Build a third, a
fourth, and so on. By building Gigafactory 1 this way, Tesla started
turning out batteries and earning revenue within a year of the
announcement, even as work continued on the whole giant facility, which
will consist of twenty-one "Lego blocks" when
completed.^[19](#notes.xhtml#note_236){#chapter009.xhtml_not_236}^

The key elements of modularity appear to be central to Elon Musk's
general approach to engineering, and he uses them in remarkably
different ventures. Tesla would seem to have nothing to do with SpaceX,
a Musk creation that is revolutionizing space transport and services.
But the use of replicability to shoot up the learning curve, accelerate
delivery, and improve performance is woven into the company's planning
and delivery
model.^[20](#notes.xhtml#note_237){#chapter009.xhtml_not_237}^

Space has long been dominated by big, complex one-off projects, and
priced accordingly, with NASA's James Webb Space Telescope---\$8.8
billion, 450 percent over budget---just the latest example. But there
are promising signs that the lessons of modularity are taking hold. To
make satellites, a company called Planet (formerly Planet Labs, Inc.)
uses commercial, off-the-shelf electronics, like those mass produced for
cell phones and drones, made into 10 × 10 × 10 cm (4 × 4 × 4 inch)
modules as cheaply and easily as possible. These are their Lego. They're
assembled into larger so-called CubeSat modules. Assemble three CubeSat
modules and you have the electronics for one Planet Dove satellite. In
sharp contrast to the large, complex, expensive satellites that have
long been the norm, each Dove satellite takes only a few months to
build, weighs eleven pounds, and costs less
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_170 .pagebreak aria-label="170"
role="doc-pagebreak"}than \$1 million---peanuts by the standards of
satellites and cheap enough that failure will result in learning, not
bankruptcy. Planet has put hundreds of these satellites into orbit,
where they form "flocks" that monitor the climate, farm conditions,
disaster response, and urban planning. Despite privacy concerns that
need addressing by policy makers, Dove satellites are a powerful
illustration of the adaptability and scalability of modular systems,
especially when contrasted with NASA's bespoke
approach.^[21](#notes.xhtml#note_238){#chapter009.xhtml_not_238}^

Subways would seem to be an even harder case for modularization, but
when Madrid Metro carried out one of the world's largest subway
expansions between 1995 and 2003, it leaned on modularity in two ways.
First, the seventy-six stations required for the expansion were treated
like Lego, with all sharing the same simple, clean, functional design.
Costs plunged, and speed of delivery soared. To amplify those effects,
Madrid Metro shunned new technologies. Only proven technologies---those
with a high degree of "frozen experience"---were used.

Second, the Metro leadership made an important conceptual breakthrough
by also treating lengths of tunnel as Lego. Initially, they calculated
the optimal length of tunnel that one boring machine and its crew could
deliver---typically three to six kilometers in two hundred to four
hundred days. Then they divided the total length of tunnels they needed
to bore by that amount and hired the number of teams and machines they
needed to meet the schedule. At times, they had up to six machines
working at once, which was unheard of at the
time.^[22](#notes.xhtml#note_239){#chapter009.xhtml_not_239}^ Treating
lengths of tunnel like Lego pushed the project further up the positive
learning curve, cut the total time required, and saved buckets of
money.^[23](#notes.xhtml#note_240){#chapter009.xhtml_not_240}^ In total,
Madrid Metro produced 131 kilometers (81 miles) of rail and seventy-six
stations in just two stages of four years each. That's twice the speed
of the industry average. And it did so at half the cost. We need more
behavior like this in megaproject management.

[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_171 .pagebreak aria-label="171"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Then there is freight shipping. Since time
immemorial, stevedores carefully loaded a ship by hand, one item at a
time, so the cargo wouldn't shift at sea, and when the ship got to its
destination, the process was reversed. It was hard, dangerous, slow
work. But in the 1950s, an American shipper named Malcolm McLean thought
that maybe cargo should be put into identical steel boxes that could be
stacked into ships and transferred directly to trains and trucks at the
destination. It was a modest idea; McLean thought it would reduce costs
somewhat.

But by turning cargo into Lego, it made shipping extremely modular and
cost effective. The stacks on ships got taller. The ships got bigger.
The transfer from one mode of transportation to another got quicker. The
speed and ease of transporting goods soared, while costs plunged so
steeply that the economics of production and distribution worldwide were
changed. In *The Box: How the Shipping Container Made the World Smaller
and the World Economy Bigger,* the definitive history of
containerization, the economist Marc Levinson argued compellingly that
the humble shipping container was nothing less than a major cause of
globalization.^[24](#notes.xhtml#note_241){#chapter009.xhtml_not_241}^

It's no small accomplishment to drastically reduce costs and boost
speeds. But modularization does more than that; it radically reduces
risk---to such an extent that modularization may be the most effective
way to "cut the tail," as recommended in chapter 6.

### [THIN-TAILED PROJECTS]{.sans} {.author-head1}

By now you know the solution to the puzzle I discussed at the end of the
previous chapter: Only five project types---solar power, wind power,
fossil thermal power, electricity transmission, and roads---are not
fat-tailed, meaning that they, unlike all the rest, do not have a
considerable risk of going disastrously wrong. So what sets the
fortunate five apart? They are all modular to a considerable degree,
some extremely so.

[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_172 .pagebreak aria-label="172"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Solar power? It's born modular, with the solar cell
as the basic building block. In a factory, put multiple solar cells
together onto a panel. Ship and install the panel. Install another, and
wire them together. Add another panel. And another until you have an
array. Keep adding arrays until you are generating as much electricity
as you like. Even giant solar farms consist of little more than that.
Solar power is the king of modularity. It is also the lowest-risk
project type of any I've tested in terms of cost and schedule. That's no
coincidence.

Wind power? Also extremely modular. Modern windmills consist of four
basic factory-built elements assembled on-site: a base, a tower, the
"head" (nacelle) that houses the generator, and the blades that spin.
Snap them together, and you have one windmill. Repeat this process again
and again, and you have a wind farm.

Fossil thermal power? Look inside a coal-burning power plant, say, and
you'll find that they're pretty simple, consisting of a few basic
factory-built elements assembled to make a big pot of water boil and run
a turbine. They're modular, much as a modern truck is modular. The same
goes for oil- and gas-fired plants.

Electricity transmission? Parts made in a factory are assembled into a
tower, and factory-made wires are strung along them. Repeat. Or
manufactured cables are dug into the ground, section by section. Repeat
again.

Roads? A multibillion-dollar freeway consists of several
multimillion-dollar freeway sections strung together. Repeat, repeat,
repeat. Learning from the delivery of one section can be applied to
another, just as the workers who put up the Empire State Building
learned from one floor to the next. Moreover, once learning is in place,
freeway sections can be built simultaneously to reduce time.

Following is a chart with all the project types arranged by how
"fat-tailed" they are in terms of cost---meaning how much they are in
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_173 .pagebreak aria-label="173"
role="doc-pagebreak"}danger of the extreme cost overruns that destroy
projects and careers, blow up corporations, and humiliate governments.

![Start of image description, A scatter chart is divided into two along
the x-axis -- fat tails and thin tails. Projects with fat tails,
starting from the fattest and moving towards the dividing line, are
nuclear storage, Olympics, nuclear power, IT, hydroelectric dam,
airport, dam, defense, building, aerospace, tunnel, mining, rail,
bridge, bus rapid transit, oil and gas, water and pipeline. projects
with thin tails, starting closest to the dividing line and moving away
to the thinnest, are road, energy transmission, thermal, wind power and
solar., end of image description](images/img_002.jpg)

At one extreme---the terrifying place where no one wants to be---we find
storage of nuclear waste, hosting the Olympic Games, construction of
nuclear power plants, building information technology systems, and
constructing hydroelectric dams. They are all classic "one huge thing"
projects. At the other extreme, we find the five blessed project types
that are not subject to fat-tailed risks. They're all modular. (So are
pipelines, which fall a whisker below the cutoff line.) And look at
solar and wind power: They're way out there, sitting pretty. And they
are *extremely* modular. Which explains why they are fast outcompeting
other energy sources---fossil, nuclear, hydro---on
price.^[25](#notes.xhtml#note_242){#chapter009.xhtml_not_242}^

The pattern is clear: Modular projects are in much less danger of
turning into fat-tailed disasters. So modular is faster, cheaper, *and*
less risky. That is a fact of immense importance.

### []{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_174 .pagebreak aria-label="174" role="doc-pagebreak"}[HOW TO SAVE *TRILLIONS* OF DOLLARS]{.sans} {.author-head1}

In the years before the Covid pandemic, unprecedented amounts of public
and private money poured into giant infrastructure projects around the
world. In the years since, that spending has turned into a torrent,
particularly in the United States, China, and the European Union. The
sums involved are staggering. Back in 2017, before it really ramped up,
I estimated that between \$6 trillion and \$9 trillion per year would be
spent globally on giant projects in the following decade. That estimate
was conservative compared to others, which went as high as \$22 trillion
per year.^[26](#notes.xhtml#note_243){#chapter009.xhtml_not_243}^ Add
the postpandemic surge of investment, and it's certain that my estimate
is now too low. Yet consider what even that low number means.

If the dismal record of big projects were improved even a little---by
cutting the cost by a mere 5 percent, say---\$300 billion to \$400
billion would be saved per year. That's roughly the annual gross
domestic product of Norway. Add equivalent improvements in the benefits
delivered by giant projects, and the gains would be in the range of the
GDP of Sweden. Each year. But as Frank Gehry and the Madrid Metro
leadership have demonstrated, a 5 percent improvement is nothing.
Cutting cost by 30 percent---which is still modest and entirely
possible---would create annual savings in the range of the GDP of the
United Kingdom, Germany, or Japan.

Those are world-changing numbers. To put them in perspective, a 2020
study funded by the German government estimated that the total cost to
end global hunger by 2030 would be \$330 billion over ten years---a
fraction of what could be gained by doing big projects a little
better.^[27](#notes.xhtml#note_244){#chapter009.xhtml_not_244}^

### []{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_175 .pagebreak aria-label="175" role="doc-pagebreak"}[THE CHINA EXPERIMENT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Some readers will object that I have been unfair to the "one huge thing"
model. They will argue that "one huge thing" projects---for instance,
nuclear power plants---are hamstrung by public opinion, hostile
governments, and the burdens of excessive safety and environmental
regulation. Break the chains, they say, and those projects could perform
just as well as or better than their modular competitors, wind and solar
power. It's an interesting hypothesis. Fortunately, a natural experiment
put it to the test and we have the results.

The experiment was conducted in China over the past decade. Red tape and
NIMBY opposition can and do indeed slow or stop projects in many
countries, but not in China. In China, if the national government at the
highest levels decides that a project is a priority, obstacles are
eliminated and the project gets done.

For more than a decade, the Chinese government has deemed it nothing
less than a national strategic imperative to massively grow China's
capacity for nonfossil electricity generation. It wants more of
everything: more wind power, more solar power, more nuclear power. And
it wants it all as fast as possible.

So how quickly have those three project types been delivered in China?
The chart on the next page, adapted from work done by the energy analyst
Michael Barnard and updated with data from the International Renewable
Energy Agency, shows the megawatts of new electricity-generating
capacity added to China's national grid, by source, from 2001 to
2020.^[28](#notes.xhtml#note_245){#chapter009.xhtml_not_245}^

The results couldn't be clearer. The "one huge thing" model, exemplified
by nuclear power, is the line crawling along the bottom of the diagram.
It was crushed by "many small things"---wind and solar power---shooting
up to the right. China is a critical case in the sense that it is the
nation in the world with the most conducive conditions for nuclear
power. So if nuclear power doesn't succeed in scaling up there, it is
unlikely to succeed anywhere---unless, of course, the nuclear industry
disrupts itself, which is exactly what its more enlightened proponents
now suggest. They have come to accept the limitations of the "one huge
thing" model and are trying to take nuclear power in a radically
different direction. They call for scaled-down reactors to be built in
factories, shipped to where they are needed, and assembled on-site,
again transforming the construction site into an assembly site, which is
rightly seen as the key to success. These reactors would each produce
only 10 to 20 percent of the electricity generated by a conventional
nuclear reactor. But if more electricity is needed, a second reactor
could be added. Or a third. Or however []{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_176
.pagebreak aria-label="176" role="doc-pagebreak"}many are
required.^[29](#notes.xhtml#note_246){#chapter009.xhtml_not_246}^ The
name of this new model for nuclear power says it all: They are "small
modular reactors," or SMRs.

At the time of writing, SMRs are an unproven technology. I won't guess
if they will ultimately work as hoped or how long it will take for them
to do so. But it is telling that after more than sixty years of civilian
nuclear power development, much of the nuclear industry---supported by a
roster of investors that includes Bill Gates and Warren Buffett---is
finally shifting its thinking from "one huge thing" to "many small
things."^[30](#notes.xhtml#note_247){#chapter009.xhtml_not_247}^ Other
"one huge thing" forms of global infrastructure should watch and learn.

### [CLIMATE CRISIS]{.sans} {.author-head1}

I would have liked to end this book right there. But I can't because
there is a far more urgent and frightening reason why we need to
radically improve how we plan and deliver big projects. It is climate
change.

In mid-July 2021, the skies opened and deluged western Germany, with
some regions getting more rain in one day than they normally get in a
month. Flash floods tore through the countryside. Towns were gutted. At
least two hundred people died. While Germany was drowning, northwest
America, from Oregon to British Columbia, baked in a heat wave that
pushed temperatures to heights once thought impossible. Crops withered.
Wildfires roared through forests, and a town in British Columbia was
reduced to ash. One estimate of the number of Americans killed by the
high temperatures put it at
600.^[31](#notes.xhtml#note_248){#chapter009.xhtml_not_248}^ The number
of Canadians killed by the heat wave in British Columbia is believed to
be 595.^[32](#notes.xhtml#note_249){#chapter009.xhtml_not_249}^
Globally, the World Health Organization estimates that between 2030 and
2050 "climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000
additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and
heat stress."^[33](#notes.xhtml#note_250){#chapter009.xhtml_not_250}^

Extreme weather events have always happened, but climate change
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_178 .pagebreak aria-label="178"
role="doc-pagebreak"}is making them more frequent and more extreme. And
they will keep getting more frequent and more extreme. The only question
is how much more.

Consider what the scientific panel that advises the United Nations said
about a heat wave severe enough that, in the past, before humanity
started changing the atmosphere, could be expected to happen once every
fifty years. Today, the globe is 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than it was
then. As a result, that same heat wave can be expected to happen 4.8
times over fifty years, or once every ten years. If the temperature
increase gets to 2 degrees, it will happen 8.6 times over fifty years,
or once every six years. With a 5.3-degree increase, it will strike 39.2
times over fifty years---once every fifteen months---turning a rare and
dangerous event into a new
normal.^[34](#notes.xhtml#note_251){#chapter009.xhtml_not_251}^

The same holds true for hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires, ice
melt, and more. With each, the fat tails---the extremes---are getting
fatter and fatter. If that progression is soon slowed and eventually
stopped, our world will continue to be one in which humanity can thrive.
If not, we will be in deep
trouble.^[35](#notes.xhtml#note_252){#chapter009.xhtml_not_252}^

To halt climate change before it becomes catastrophic, most of the
nations of the world have committed to a target of "net zero by 2050,"
meaning that by midcentury they will emit no more greenhouse gases into
the atmosphere than they take out. Scientists estimate that if the world
collectively hits that target we will have a good shot at limiting the
temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. That sounds simple enough. But
it's hard to overstate how ambitious the goal is, and how central good
project delivery is to achieving it.

In 2021, the International Energy Agency, an autonomous
intergovernmental organization established within the framework of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), released
a detailed report examining what would be required to get to net
zero.^[36](#notes.xhtml#note_253){#chapter009.xhtml_not_253}^ It found
that fossil fuels, which today account for four-fifths of the world's
energy production, could provide no more than one-fifth
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_179 .pagebreak aria-label="179"
role="doc-pagebreak"}in 2050.Replacing them would require a vast
increase in electrification---our grandchildren will encounter gas
stations only in history books---and an explosion in the production of
electricity by renewable energy sources. Wind power must grow
elevenfold. Solar power must grow a mind-boggling
twentyfold.^[37](#notes.xhtml#note_254){#chapter009.xhtml_not_254}^
Investment in renewable energy must triple by 2030, mostly delivered as
hundreds, if not thousands, of large-scale, multibillion-dollar wind and
solar farms. New nuclear and new hydro may have a role to play for the
2050 deadline, but for 2030 they have already proven too slow.

Furthermore, technologies that are now only concepts and prototypes must
soon be ready for massive rollouts. A major one, if it can be made to
work at scale, is so-called carbon capture, utilization, and storage
(carbon capture, for short), which takes carbon out of the air and
either stores it underground or uses it as a raw material in industrial
processes. Another is industrial-scale electrolyzer capacity that uses
wind- or solar-powered electricity to generate hydrogen. Every month
from 2030 onward, the International Energy Agency says, ten heavy
industrial plants must be equipped with carbon capture, three new
hydrogen-based industrial plants must be built, and two gigawatts of
electrolyzer capacity must be added at industrial sites. *Every month.*

There's much more that must be done, but you get the idea: We're talking
about projects at a scale and in numbers never seen before in human
history, without which mitigating and adapting to climate change will be
impossible. Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International
Energy Agency, put it bluntly: "The scale and speed of the efforts
demanded by this critical and formidable goal . . . make this perhaps
the greatest challenge humankind has ever
faced."^[38](#notes.xhtml#note_255){#chapter009.xhtml_not_255}^

"Scale and speed"; those are the key words. To win the fight against
climate change, we must build at a scale and speed that put to shame the
long, sorry record of the giant projects of the past. We can no longer
afford bloated budgets and deadlines that keep sliding into the
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_180 .pagebreak aria-label="180"
role="doc-pagebreak"}future. And we absolutely cannot have projects that
never deliver what they promise. There is no room for more Monjus or
California High-Speed Rail. In our present situation, wasted resources
and wasted time are a threat to civilization. We must build huge and
fast. Fortunately, we have a strong precedent for how to do that. It's
found back home, in Denmark.

### [BLOWIN' IN THE WIND]{.sans} {.author-head1}

In the 1950s and 1960s, Denmark, like many other countries, became
dependent on cheap oil from the Middle East. When OPEC embargoed the
West in 1973, the Danish economy slumped, and its vulnerability became
clear to all. A furious hunt for new sources of energy led Denmark to
rapidly expand its use of coal, oil, and natural gas from nearby
sources. But a few pioneers went in a different direction. Denmark is a
small, flat country buffeted by ocean winds. We should harness that
power, they said, and by 1978 the country had built the world's first
multimegawatt wind turbine at Tvind in Jutland, which is still operating
today.

People tinkered in garages and on farms, experimenting with designs,
sizes, and locations. But even with tax breaks for investors, onshore
wind power remained a modest, peripheral industry, in part because
Denmark doesn't have lots of uninhabited land and people don't want to
live in the shadow of wind turbines. In the late 1990s, a visionary
Danish minister of the environment, Svend Auken, told companies seeking
permission to build coal-powered generators that they could go ahead on
the condition that they also build two of the world's first offshore
wind farms. They did. One worked, the other was a mess. Both gave the
owners *experiri.* It was a start.

When a group of Danish energy companies merged in 2006 and became DONG
Energy, a company now known as Ørsted, the new company inherited the
offshore wind farms, plus another in the Irish
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_181 .pagebreak aria-label="181"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Sea. They were minor assets for a company that
worked almost exclusively with fossil fuels, but they were enough to
ensure that "by coincidence we became the most experienced guys on
offshore wind," recalled Anders Eldrup, the new company's first
CEO.^[39](#notes.xhtml#note_256){#chapter009.xhtml_not_256}^

In 2009, the United Nations held a landmark conference in Copenhagen to
discuss climate change, and Eldrup made a bold announcement there. Some
85 percent of his company's energy came from fossil fuels at the time
and only 15 percent from renewables, mostly wind. Within a generation,
he promised, his "85/15 plan" would reverse those numbers. That wasn't
merely ambitious; lots of observers thought it was impossible. The
technology of wind power was too immature and much too costly. Even with
government contracts guaranteeing the purchase of electricity at
generous rates for years to come, investors were wary. What they didn't
appreciate was the extreme modularity of offshore wind farms. Assemble
four Lego---foundation, tower, head, blades; click, click, click---and
you have a turbine that can start generating electricity immediately.
Assemble eight to ten turbines and wire them together, and you have a
"string" that can be connected to a substation that feeds into the
national electricity grid. It, too, can start delivering as soon as it
is assembled. Put together a few strings, and you have a wind farm that
is operational on day one. Repeat, repeat, repeat. It can scale up as
much as you like, with each iteration pushing everyone up the learning
curve.

"We knew that we had to reduce the cost of offshore wind dramatically to
make it competitive, and we set a target to reduce it by thirty-five to
forty percent over a seven-year period," recalled Henrik Poulsen, who
took over from the retiring Anders Eldrup as CEO in
2012.^[40](#notes.xhtml#note_257){#chapter009.xhtml_not_257}^ The
company and its partners made improvements in every aspect of the
business.The most dramatic was growth in the size of turbines. Whereas a
turbine in 2000 might have been a little taller than the Statue of
Liberty and able to power 1,500 homes, a turbine in 2017 was almost
double that height and capable of powering 7,100 homes.

[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_182 .pagebreak aria-label="182"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The size of wind farms grew even faster. An
offshore wind farm the company completed in 2013 covered 88 square
kilometers (34 square miles); the first phase of its Hornsea Project off
the coast of England, completed in 2020, covered 407 square kilometers
(157 square miles). When the second phase of the Hornsea Project is
finished, the whole thing will cover 869 square kilometers (336 square
miles), making it considerably bigger than the 784 square kilometers
(303 square miles) of New York City's five boroughs.

The explosive growth drove down costs. "It turns out," said Poulsen,
"that once we got going, once we started taking on offshore wind
projects in the UK and later on in Germany, Denmark, and the
Netherlands, once we started industrializing and standardizing the way
we were building offshore wind farms, once we got the whole industry
value chain focused on it, that within four years we had reduced the
cost of offshore wind by 60 percent." That was more than expected and
three years ahead of schedule. Wind power became cheaper than fossil
fuels faster than anyone had dreamed
of.^[41](#notes.xhtml#note_258){#chapter009.xhtml_not_258}^ There was no
optimism bias there; quite the opposite.

In 2017, with oil and gas vanishing from its business, Ørsted took its
new name in honor of the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted, who
discovered electromagnetism. Two years later, Anders Eldrup's
"impossible" 85/15 plan was achieved. It hadn't taken a generation; it
had taken ten
years.^[42](#notes.xhtml#note_259){#chapter009.xhtml_not_259}^ Again
that was better than expected and a full fifteen years ahead of
schedule, unheard of for conventional Big Energy projects.

Over the same ten years, the percentage of Denmark's electricity
generated by fossil fuels fell from 72 percent to 24 percent, while the
share contributed by wind power soared from 18 percent to 56
percent.^[43](#notes.xhtml#note_260){#chapter009.xhtml_not_260}^ Some
days, Danish wind turbines produce more electricity than the country can
consume. The surplus is exported to neighboring nations.

For Denmark, the benefits of this revolution are likely to be felt for
[]{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_183 .pagebreak aria-label="183"
role="doc-pagebreak"}decades. The global wind energy industry is
booming, with everbigger developments popping up all over the world, and
many of the leading companies are Danish thanks to Denmark's pioneering
role. Ørsted has gone global. So has Vestas, one of the world's largest
manufacturers of wind turbines, also
Danish.^[44](#notes.xhtml#note_261){#chapter009.xhtml_not_261}^ And many
of the smaller, specialized firms in the industry not only come from
Denmark, they come specifically from Jutland, the region where people
first started experimenting with turbines in the 1970s. Henrik Poulsen,
who now advises an investment company, described how his firm recently
bought a Danish company that makes control systems for wind farms: "Now
we want to expand this company and we're looking for companies that we
could merge into this platform." Naturally, they're looking around the
world. But the prospects they've found "are all located within a few
hundred kilometers" of each other in Jutland. "Which is a bit crazy,"
said Poulsen. Economic geographers like myself call this "clustering" or
"economies of agglomeration." It's what happened for film in Hollywood
in the 1920s and for tech in Silicon Valley in the mid--twentieth
century. Jutland is now the Silicon Valley of wind energy---which is
striking for a country whose population is just over half that of Los
Angeles County.

### [A FIGHTING CHANCE]{.sans} {.author-head1}

But this isn't about Denmark. It's about the world and what we can learn
from Denmark's wind power revolution. Part of the lesson is that
government has a role in development."Without the governmentcreated
framework, this never would have happened," noted Anders Eldrup. This
approach may not be popular in the United States, but ironically, the
United States is the model. The whole digital revolution, which the
American giants of Silicon Valley dominate, could not have happened
without US government support for the creation of digital technologies,
including what became the Internet. If you []{#chapter009.xhtml_Page_184
.pagebreak aria-label="184" role="doc-pagebreak"}want to start an
avalanche big enough to change the world, government may have to help
push the first boulder.

But the more fundamental lesson is the power of modularity. It was
modularity that enabled learning so rapid and growth so explosive that
Denmark was able to revolutionize both wind power technology and its own
electricity supply faster than anyone expected, including the innovators
themselves, and in less time than it takes many countries to deliver a
single "one huge thing" project. That's huge and fast. That's the model
we need: "many small things" manufactured at scale and assembled like
Lego, click, click, click.

The implications for governments and corporations are clear: encourage,
support, and practice a modular approach. But it is also empowering for
individuals. When small can scale up and become huge fast, small
experiments have huge potential. All it takes is imagination and
tenacity. Remember that much of today's global wind industry can be
traced back to a handful of Danes tinkering in garages and farms. Use
your imagination. Get tinkering.

With new ideas and the relentless application of the modular model, we
will have a fighting chance to deliver the transformation people and the
planet need.

## ELEVEN HEURISTICS FOR BETTER PROJECT LEADERSHIP {.chapter-title}

Heuristics are fast and frugal rules of thumb used to simplify complex
decisions. The word has its origin in the ancient Greek word *Eureka!,*
the cry of joy and satisfaction when one finds or discovers
something.^[1](#notes.xhtml#note_262){#chapter010.xhtml_not_262}^ "Think
slow, act fast" is an example of a heuristic. Experts and laypeople
alike use them when making decisions under
uncertainty.^[2](#notes.xhtml#note_263){#chapter010.xhtml_not_263}^
Heuristics are mental shortcuts used to reduce complexity, making
decisions manageable. Heuristics are often tacit and need to be
deliberately teased out before they can be shared verbally. Wise people,
including successful project leaders---plus your grandmother and anyone
else with *phronesis*---work to refine and improve their heuristics
throughout life.^[3](#notes.xhtml#note_264){#chapter010.xhtml_not_264}^

The following are eleven of my favorite heuristics, developed during
decades of studying and managing big
projects.^[4](#notes.xhtml#note_265){#chapter010.xhtml_not_265}^ But a
word of warning: Heuristics should never be used like thoughtless
paint-by-numbers rules. Check whether my heuristics resonate with your
own experience before using them in practice. Even more important, use
them as a source of inspiration for investigating, trying new things,
and developing your own heuristics---which is what really matters. For
how to do this and why, read the references, advance your experience,
and watch your ability to turn bold visions into concrete reality
radically improve.

### []{#chapter010.xhtml_Page_186 .pagebreak aria-label="186" role="doc-pagebreak"}[HIRE A MASTERBUILDER]{.sans} {.author-head1}

I sometimes say that this is my only heuristic because the
masterbuilder---named after the skilled masons who built Europe's
medieval cathedrals---possesses all the *phronesis* needed to make your
project happen. You want someone with deep domain experience and a
proven track record of success in whatever you're doing, whether it's a
home renovation, a wedding, an IT system, or a skyscraper. But
masterbuilders aren't always available or affordable, in which case you
need to think further and consider some of the following.

### [GET YOUR TEAM RIGHT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

This is the only heuristic cited by every project leader I've ever met.
Ed Catmull explained why: "Give a good idea to a mediocre team, and they
will screw it up. Give a mediocre idea to a great team, and they will
either fix it or come up with something better. If you get the team
right, chances are they will get the ideas
right."^[5](#notes.xhtml#note_266){#chapter010.xhtml_not_266}^ But who
should pick the team? Ideally, that's the job of a masterbuilder. In
fact, it's the masterbuilder's main job. This is why the role of
masterbuilder is not as solitary as it sounds; projects are delivered by
teams. So to amend my advice above: When possible, hire a masterbuilder.
And the masterbuilder's team.

### [ASK "WHY?"]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Asking why you're doing your project will focus you on what matters,
your ultimate purpose, and your result. This goes into the box on the
right of your project chart. As the project sails into a storm of events
and details, good leaders never lose sight of the ultimate result. "No
matter where I am and what I'm doing in the delivery process," noted
[]{#chapter010.xhtml_Page_187 .pagebreak aria-label="187"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Andrew Wolstenholme, the leader who delivered
Heathrow's Terminal 5 in chapter 8, "I check myself constantly by asking
whether my present actions effectively contribute to the result on the
right." (See [chapter 3](#chapter003.xhtml).)

### [BUILD WITH LEGO]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Big is best built from small. Bake one small cake. Bake another. And
another. Then stack them. Decoration aside, that's all there really is
to even the most towering wedding cake. As with wedding cakes, so with
solar and wind farms, server farms, batteries, container shipping,
pipelines, roads. They're all profoundly modular, built with a basic
building block. They can scale up like crazy, getting better, faster,
bigger, and cheaper as they do. The small cake is the Lego brick---the
basic building block---of the wedding cake. The solar panel is the Lego
of the solar farm. The server is the Lego of the server farm. This
potent little idea has been applied to software, subways, hardware,
hotels, office buildings, schools, factories, hospitals, rockets,
satellites, cars, and app stores. Its applicability is limited only by
imagination. So what's your Lego? (See [chapter 9](#chapter009.xhtml).)

### [THINK SLOW, ACT FAST]{.sans} {.author-head1}

What's the worst that can happen during planning? Maybe your whiteboard
is accidentally erased. What's the worst that can happen during
delivery? Your drill breaks through the ocean floor, flooding the
tunnel. Just before you release your movie, a pandemic closes theaters.
You ruin the most beautiful vista in Washington, DC. You have to
dynamite months of work on the opera house, clear away the rubble, and
start over. Your overpass collapses, killing dozens of people. And so
much more. Almost any nightmare you can imagine can
[]{#chapter010.xhtml_Page_188 .pagebreak aria-label="188"
role="doc-pagebreak"}happen---and *has* happened---during delivery. You
want to limit your exposure to this. You do it by taking all the time
necessary to create a detailed, tested plan. Planning is relatively
cheap and safe; delivering is expensive and dangerous. Good planning
boosts the odds of a quick, effective delivery, keeping the window on
risk small and closing it as soon as possible. (See [chapter
1](#chapter001.xhtml).)

### [TAKE THE OUTSIDE VIEW]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Your project is special, but unless you are doing what has literally
never been done before---building a time machine, engineering a black
hole---it is not unique; it is part of a larger class of projects. Think
of your project as "one of those," gather data, and learn from all the
experience those numbers represent by making reference-class forecasts.
Use the same focus to spot and mitigate risks. Switching the focus from
your project to the class your project belongs to will lead,
paradoxically, to a more accurate understanding of your project. (See
[chapter 6](#chapter006.xhtml).)

### [WATCH YOUR DOWNSIDE]{.sans} {.author-head1}

It's often said that opportunity is as important as risk. That's false.
Risk can kill you or your project. No upside can compensate for that.
For fat-tailed risk, which is present in most projects, forget about
forecasting risk; go directly to mitigation by spotting and eliminating
dangers. A rider in the grueling three-week Tour de France bicycle race
explained that participating is not about winning but about not losing,
each day for twenty-one days. Only after that can you consider winning.
Successful project leaders think like that; they focus on not losing,
every day, while keeping a keen eye on the prize, the goal they are
trying to achieve.

### []{#chapter010.xhtml_Page_189 .pagebreak aria-label="189" role="doc-pagebreak"}[SAY NO AND WALK AWAY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

Staying focused is essential for getting projects done. Saying no is
essential for staying focused. At the outset, will the project have the
people and funds, including contingencies, needed to succeed? If not,
walk away. Does an action contribute to achieving the goal in the box on
the right? If not, skip it. Say no to monuments. No to untested
technology. No to lawsuits. And so on. This can be difficult,
particularly if your organization embraces a bias for action. But saying
no is essential for the success of a project and an organization. "I'm
actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things we have
done," Steve Jobs once observed. The things not done helped Apple stay
focused on a few products that became wildly successful because of that
focus, according to
Jobs.^[6](#notes.xhtml#note_267){#chapter010.xhtml_not_267}^

### [MAKE FRIENDS AND KEEP THEM FRIENDLY]{.sans} {.author-head1}

A leader of a multibillion-dollar public sector IT project told me he
spent more than half his time acting like a diplomat, cultivating the
understanding and support of stakeholders who could significantly
influence his project. Why? It's risk management. If something goes
wrong, the project's fate depends on the strength of those
relationships. And when something goes wrong, it's too late to start
developing and cultivating them. Build your bridges before you need
them.

### [BUILD CLIMATE MITIGATION INTO YOUR PROJECT]{.sans} {.author-head1}

No task is more urgent today than mitigating the climate crisis---not
only for the common good but for your organization, yourself, and your
family. Aristotle defined *phronesis* as the dual ability to see what
things are good for people *and* to get those things done. We know
what's []{#chapter010.xhtml_Page_190 .pagebreak aria-label="190"
role="doc-pagebreak"}good: climate mitigation, for instance, by
electrifying everything---homes, cars, offices, factories, shops---and
making sure that the electricity comes from abundant renewable sources.
We have the ability to do this. In fact, it's already happening, as we
saw in chapter 9. Now it's a matter of quickly accelerating and scaling
up the effort with thousands more mitigation (and adaptation) projects,
large and small, following the principles laid out in this book---which
was a main motivation for writing it and for hammering out this list of
heuristics.

### [KNOW THAT YOUR BIGGEST RISK IS YOU]{.sans} {.author-head1}

It's tempting to think that projects fail because the world throws
surprises at us: price and scope changes, accidents, weather, new
management---the list goes on. But this is shallow thinking. The Great
Chicago Fire Festival failed not because Jim Lasko couldn't predict the
exact chain of circumstances that led to the malfunction of the ignition
system (see [chapter 6](#chapter006.xhtml)); it failed because he took
the inside view on his project and didn't study how failure typically
occurs for live events as a class. Why didn't he? Because focusing on
the particular case and ignoring the class is what human psychology
inclines us to do. The greatest threat Lasko faced wasn't out in the
world; it was in his own head, in his behavioral biases. This is true
for every one of us and every project. Which is why your biggest risk is
you.

## BASE RATES FOR COST RISK^[\*](#footnotes.xhtml#fn_1){#app.xhtml_fnt_1}^ {.chapter-title}

The table on the next page shows cost overruns for twenty-five project
types covering sixteen thousand--plus projects. Overrun is measured as
(a) mean cost overrun, (b) percentage of projects in the upper tail
(defined as ≥ 50 percent), and (c) mean overrun in the tail. Overrun is
measured in real terms.

The numbers in the table are base rates for cost risk in project
management. For example, if you're planning to host the Olympic Games,
your base rate (expected value) for cost overrun will be 157 percent,
with a 76 percent risk of ending up in the tail with an expected overrun
of 200 percent and substantial further risk of overrun above this. If
you're the sponsor or project leader, your key question should be "Can
we afford this risk?" and if not, "Should we walk away or can we reduce
the risk?"

We see from the table that the base rates are very different for
different project types for both mean risk and tail risk. The highest
mean risk is found for nuclear storage, at 238 percent, while the lowest
is found for solar power, at 1 percent. The highest risk for ending up
in the tail is held by the Olympics, at 76 percent, while the highest
mean overrun in the tail is found for IT projects, at 447 percent.
Differences in base rates must be taken into account when planning and
managing projects but often are not. Frequently, empirical base rates
are not considered at all.

![line image](images/img_005.jpg)

Writing a book is a "Big Thing." As such, it takes teamwork. I wish to
thank the many people who made the book possible. It's a big team, so
undoubtedly I forgot some, for which I ask forgiveness, but which does
not lessen their contribution or my gratitude.

Gerd Gigerenzer, Daniel Kahneman, Benoit Mandelbrot, and Nassim Nicholas
Taleb are principal intellectual influences. Nobody understands risk
better than they do, and understanding risk is *the* key to
understanding big projects. Kahneman and Taleb accepted positions as
distinguished research scholars with my group at Oxford, for which I
cannot thank them enough. It greatly facilitated intellectual exchange,
and you will see their influence throughout the book.

Frank Gehry and Ed Catmull are main practical influences. When Gehry
built the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao on time and on budget I knew I had to
pick his brain, because if you can build architecture like *that* on
time and on budget, you can build *anything* on time and on budget. So
why is it so rare, and what is Gehry's secret? Gehry generously agreed
to talk, resulting in multiple interviews. Ed Catmull is responsible for
an uninterrupted string of Hollywood blockbusters so long (the longest
in movie history) that on principle it should be statistically
impossible, given that movies are notoriously hit or miss. So how did it
happen? Catmull, too, agreed to talk, and I'm grateful to him and Gehry
for sharing their time and insights and for facilitating further
interviews with members of their teams. Both also kindly accepted
invitations to explain their thinking in lectures in my course at
Oxford.

[]{#ack.xhtml_Page_198 .pagebreak aria-label="198"
role="doc-pagebreak"}The following helpfully shared their experience in
additional interviews: Patrick Collison, Morgan Doan, Pete Docter, Simon
Douthwaite, David Drake, Anders Eldrup, Sally Forgan, Danny Forster,
Paul Gardien, Mike Green, Richard Harper, Robi Kirsic, Bernie Koth,
Eddie Kramer, Jim Lasko, Dana Macaulay, Adam Marelli, Ian McAllister,
Molly Melching, Manuel Melis, Deb Niven, Don Norman, Dominic Packer,
Henrik Poulsen, Alan South, John Storyk, Lou Thompson, Kimberly Dasher
Tripp, Ralph Vartabedian, Craig Webb, Andrew Wolstenholme, Ricky Wong,
and Micah Zenko. Besides the formal interviews, I'm grateful to the
following for their help with further information gathering: Kermit
Baker, Elena Bonometti, Scott Gilmore, Jan Haust, Paul Hillier, and Liam
Scott.

The book builds on the world's largest database of its kind, with
information regarding sixteen thousand--plus projects, big and small.
Mette Skamris Holm was key to collecting the first data with me at
Aalborg University. Chantal Cantarelli and Bert van Wee became
collaborators in further data collection when I was chair at Delft
University of Technology. Later, Chantal moved with me to the University
of Oxford, where we joined forces with Alexander Budzier, Atif Ansar,
and numerous research assistants who became essential in developing the
database into what it is today. My work as an external consultant for
McKinsey & Company contributed further data from McKinsey clients, for
which Jürgen Laartz was consequential. I wish to thank each of my
collaborators and our institutions for their help and support in
building the database, without which the book would not have been
possible.

With data come statistics and statisticians. Their work is not directly
visible in the main text, because I wanted to keep it nontechnical. But
statisticians have been hard at work in the background ensuring the
validity of results. I wish to thank, in particular, Dirk W. Bester,
Søren Buhl, Maria Christodoulou, Daniel Lunn, and []{#ack.xhtml_Page_199
.pagebreak aria-label="199" role="doc-pagebreak"}Mariagrazia Zottoli.
Readers with a technical bent can find references to the statistics in
the endnotes.

A special thank-you goes to my long-suffering co-author, Dan Gardner,
who worked with me for over two years, developing ideas, finding case
studies past and present, and helping me tell my story far better than I
could have. Dan had to put up with my scholarly nitpicking of every word
and sentence. I want to compliment him for never losing his cool in the
process and for defending the storyline as vigorously as I defended the
scholarship in our writing.

Special thanks also to Alexander Budzier, my alter ego and closest
collaborator in megaproject management. Many years ago, we committed to
being partners through thick and thin. I hope Alex thinks I've kept my
word as well as I think he has his. There is no one I'd rather have by
my side when we crunch the numbers or are deep in the "big muddy,"
trying to turn around some multibillion-dollar project that's gone off
its rails, as we did in chapter 6. Alex has helped with everything, from
data to ideas to fact-checking.

A writer could not ask for a better agent than Jim Levine. Jim was the
first to see the potential of *How Big Things Get Done* when the book
was only an idea. Without him the idea would have remained just that.
Jim also provided feedback on the writing, made effective edits to the
manuscript, and helped nail the title in an exemplary team effort. My
gratitude to all the team at Levine Greenberg Rostan Literary Agency.
Courtney Paganelli was always encouraging and incredibly helpful in
turning the fledgling project into the beginnings of a book.

I'm thankful to everyone at Random House. Talia Krohn and Paul Whitlatch
edited the manuscript with vision and insight, much improving the
result. Doug Pepper gave highly useful comments. Katie Berry kept the
manuscript organized and on schedule. Lynn Anderson masterly copyedited
the final draft. Thanks to Robert Siek, []{#ack.xhtml_Page_200
.pagebreak aria-label="200" role="doc-pagebreak"}Katie Zilberman, and
Fritz Metsch for producing such a beautifully finished book, Jessie
Bright for designing the stylish jacket, Jane Farnol for compiling the
index, and Cozetta Smith, Dyana Messina, Mason Eng, and Julie Cepler for
doing everything possible to help convey the messages within to a wide
audience without. Thanks also to David Drake, Gillian Blake, Annsley
Rosner, Michelle Giuseffi, Sally Franklin, Allison Fox, and the rest of
the publishing team. Nicole Amter expertly put together the book's
bibliography.

During the research for the book, I have benefited from insightful
conversations with many brilliant mentors and colleagues. Martin Wachs,
my doctoral and postdoctoral supervisor, supported every major decision
and publication in my academic career, including the present book.
Unexpectedly, Marty died in the middle of us factchecking the California
High-Speed Rail case in the introduction, on which he was an expert. I
didn't understand why his emails suddenly---and
uncharacteristically---stopped. Then I got the tragic news. No one could
hope for a better and more generous supervisor and mentor. Marty has
left a profound and painful void. Verner C. Petersen taught me the value
of fundamental positions in philosophy and social theory for
understanding planning and management. Other important interlocutors
include Jeremy Adelman, Arun Agrawal, Michele Alacevich, Alan Altshuler,
Jørgen Andreasen, Atif Ansar, Dan Ariely, Martin Beniston, Maria

Thank you, all.

I also wish to thank the participants in the executive education
programs I have taught, including Oxford's MSc in Major Programme
Management, the UK Government's Major Projects Leadership Academy, the
Hong Kong Government's Major Projects Leadership Programme, and similar
programs in the private sector, which have given me invaluable
opportunity to test the ideas in the book with more than a thousand
top-level, high-caliber business and government executives, in
geographies as different as the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, and
Australia. Big thanks also to Atif Ansar, Alexander Budzier, Paul
Chapman, Patrick O'Connell, and Andrew White for excellent help in
co-founding, co-directing, and co-delivering these programs.

Together with Alexander Budzier I co-founded Oxford Global Projects as
an outlet to leverage our academic research in practice and as a source
of additional data. It, too, has proven a crucial testing ground for the
ideas in the book, and I wish to thank the many clients who invited us
to try our data, theories, and methods on their projects. I'm grateful
to each member of the OGP team: Rayaheen Adra, Karlene Agard, Simone
Andersen, Mike Bartlett, Radhia Benalia, Alexander Budzier, Caitlin
Combrinck, Michele Dallachiesa, Gerd Duch, Sam Franzen, Andi Garavaglia,
Adam Hede, Andreas Leed, Newton Li, and Caixia Mao.

Funding for the work on the book has come from my endowed chairs: the BT
Professorship and Chair of Major Programme Management at the University
of Oxford and the Villum Kann Rasmussen Professorship and Chair of Major
Program Management at the []{#ack.xhtml_Page_202 .pagebreak
aria-label="202" role="doc-pagebreak"}IT University of Copenhagen. I
wish to thank BT Group, the Villum Foundation, the University of Oxford,
and the IT University of Copenhagen for generously sponsoring my
research, no strings attached, creating the ideal conditions for
independent scholarship.

Gratefulness doesn't even begin to convey what I owe my family and
friends for always being there when I need them: Carissa, Maria, Ava,
August, Kasper, John, Mikala, Henrik, Olga, Claus, Damon, Finn, Frank,
Jeremy, Kim, Niels, Vaughan.

My biggest and warmest thanks go to Carissa Véliz, who was locked down
with me each day of writing the book, while completing her own. She has
influenced every aspect, from title to content to cover. Dan probably
got tired of hearing, "I'll ask Carissa," whenever he and I were unsure
or disagreed about something. But she's the wordsmith I trust the most
(read her stuff and you'll understand), and the book is significantly
better for it. Carissa read the full manuscript in detail from beginning
to end, substantially improving the writing. Finally, she helped the two
of us pull through the pandemic, despite unexpected heartbreak and being
isolated in a foreign country far from our families for what seemed like
forever. Words don't suffice to express my admiration and gratitude.
Nevertheless, from the bottom of my heart: Thank you, guapa.

^[\*](#app.xhtml#fnt_1){#footnotes.xhtml_fn_1}^ Results for schedule
risk and benefit risk are similar, albeit based on fewer data; see Bent
Flyvbjerg and Dirk W. Bester, "The Cost-Benefit Fallacy: Why
Cost-Benefit Analysis Is Broken and How to Fix It," *Journal of
Benefit-Cost Analysis* 12, no. 3 (2021): 395--419.

^[\*](#app.xhtml#fnt_2){#footnotes.xhtml_fn_2}^ Cost overrun was
calculated not including inflation and baselined as late in the project
cycle as possible, just before the go-ahead (final business case at
final investment decision). This means that the numbers in the table are
conservative. If inflation had been included and early business cases
used as the baseline, cost overrun would be much higher, sometimes
several times higher.

project is the Basic and Primary Education Project (BPEP). I worked in
close collaboration with the Danish architect Hans Lauritz Jørgensen,
who designed prototypes of schools and classrooms. I planned and
programmed the project. Later, a delivery team took over and spent
twelve years building the schools. I was offered the opportunity to head
the delivery team but respectfully declined because I had decided that
my university professorship would be my primary vocation, however much I
loved---and love---being involved in hands-on project planning and
delivery. I wanted to *really* understand what makes projects tick---at
the root-cause level---which would require in-depth university research,
in my judgment. So I returned to Denmark and my professorship to carry
out that research, first at Aalborg University and later at Delft
University of Technology in the Netherlands, the University of Oxford in
the United Kingdom, and the IT University of Copenhagen in Denmark.

role="doc-pagebreak"}(that is, not including inflation), and with a
baseline in the final business case (that is, *not* in the early outline

conservative; that is, low. If inflation were included and if the
baseline were set in earlier business cases, the overruns would be much
higher---sometimes several times higher. In mathematical terms, cost
overrun is measured in percent as O = (C~a~/C~e~−1) × 100, where O =
percentage overrun; C~a~ = actual outturn cost; C~e~ = estimated cost at
the time of the final investment decision (aka the date of decision to
build or final business case), with all costs measured in constant
(real) prices. For more detail about how cost overrun is measured and

[17](#chapter001.xhtml#not_35){#notes.xhtml_note_35}. For the
mathematically/statistically inclined reader: In probability theory and
statistics, kurtosis is a standard measure of the "tailedness" of the
probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. The Gaussian
(normal) distribution has a kurtosis of 3. Probability distributions
with a kurtosis lower than 3 have thinner tails than the Gaussian, which
is itself considered thin-tailed. Probability distributions with a
kurtosis larger than 3 are considered fat-tailed. The higher above 3 the
kurtosis is for a distribution (called "excess kurtosis"), the more
fat-tailed the distribution is considered to be. The mathematician
Benoit Mandelbrot found a kurtosis of 43.36 in []{#notes.xhtml_Page_207
.pagebreak aria-label="207" role="doc-pagebreak"}a pioneering study of
daily variations in the Standard & Poor's 500 index between 1970 and
2001---14.5 times more fat-tailed than the Gaussian---which he found
alarmingly high in terms of financial risk; see Benoit B. Mandelbrot and
Richard L. Hudson, *The (Mis)behavior of Markets* (London: Profile
Books, 2008), 96. But Mandelbrot's finding is not particularly high when
compared with the kurtosis I have found for percentage cost overruns in
information technology projects, which is 642.51, or 214 times more
fat-tailed than the Gaussian, or in water projects, with a kurtosis of
182.44. In fact, for the twenty-plus project types for which I have
data, only a handful have a kurtosis for cost overrun that indicates a
normal or near-normal distribution (the results are similar for schedule
overruns and benefit shortfalls, albeit with fewer data). A large
majority of project types has a kurtosis higher than 3---often much
higher---indicating fat-tailed and very-fat-tailed distributions.
Statistics and decision theory further talk about "kurtosis risk," which
is the risk that results when a statistical model assumes the normal (or
near-normal) distribution but is applied to observations that have a
tendency to occasionally be much further (in terms of number of standard
deviations) from the average than is expected for a normal distribution.
Project management scholarship and practice largely ignore kurtosis
risk, which is unfortunate given the extreme levels of kurtosis
documented above and which is a root cause of why this type of
management so often goes so systematically and spectacularly wrong.

[5](#chapter002.xhtml#not_53){#notes.xhtml_note_53}. Strategic
misrepresentation is sometimes also called political bias, strategic
bias, power bias, or the Machiavelli factor. This bias is a
rationalization in which the end justifies the means. The strategy
(e.g., to achieve funding) dictates the bias (e.g., make a project look
good on paper). Strategic misrepresentation can be traced to agency
problems and political-organizational pressures; for instance,
competition for scarce funds or jockeying for position. Strategic
misrepresentation is deliberate deception, and as such it is lying, per
definition; see Bent Flyvbjerg, "Top Ten Behavioral Biases in Project
Management: An Overview," *Project Management Journal* 52, no. 6

[7](#chapter002.xhtml#not_55){#notes.xhtml_note_55}. In his 2011
bestseller, *Thinking, Fast and Slow,* Kahneman would write,
[]{#notes.xhtml_Page_209 .pagebreak aria-label="209"
role="doc-pagebreak"}"Errors in the initial budget are not always
innocent. The authors of unrealistic plans are often driven by the
desire to get the plan approved---whether by their superiors or by a
client---supported by the knowledge that projects are rarely abandoned
unfinished merely because of overruns in costs or completion times" (pp.
250--51). That is clearly not a description of psychological cognitive
bias, which is innocent per definition, but of political bias,
specifically strategic misrepresentation aimed at getting projects under
way. For a more full account of my discussions with Daniel Kahneman
about power bias and strategic misrepresentation, see Flyvbjerg, "Top
Ten Behavioral Biases in Project Management."

Behavioral Biases in Project Management."

[9](#chapter002.xhtml#not_57){#notes.xhtml_note_57}. Optimism is a
well-documented cognitive bias. It is the tendency for individuals to be
overly bullish about the outcomes of planned actions. The neuroscientist
Sharot Tali calls it "one of the greatest deceptions of which the human
mind is capable." Whereas strategic misrepresentation is deliberate,
optimism bias is nondeliberate. In the grip of optimism, people,
including experts, are unaware that they are optimistic. They make
decisions based on an ideal vision of the future rather than on a
rational weighting of gains, losses, and probabilities. They
overestimate benefits and underestimate costs. They involuntarily spin
scenarios of success and overlook the potential for mistakes and
miscalculations. As a result, plans are unlikely to deliver as expected
in terms of benefits and costs. See Tali Sharot, *The Optimism Bias: A
Tour of the Irrationally Positive Brain* (New York: Pantheon, 2011), xv;

[17](#chapter002.xhtml#not_65){#notes.xhtml_note_65}. The planning
fallacy is a subcategory of optimism bias that arises from individuals
producing plans and estimates that are unrealistically close to
best-case scenarios. The term was originally coined by Daniel Kahneman
and Amos Tversky to describe the tendency for people to underestimate
task completion times. Roger Buehler and his colleagues continued
working following this definition. Later, the concept was broadened to
cover the tendency for people to, on the one hand, underestimate costs,
schedules, and risks for planned actions and, on the other, overestimate
benefits and opportunities for those actions. Because the original
narrow and later broader concepts are so fundamentally different in the
scope they cover, with Cass Sunstein I suggested the term "planning
fallacy writ large" for the broader concept, to avoid confusing the two.

recent, more unusual, and more emotional memories being more easily
recalled. Powerful individuals have been shown to be more susceptible to
availability bias than individuals who are not powerful. The causal
mechanism seems to be that powerful individuals are affected more
strongly by ease of retrieval than by the content they retrieve because
they are more likely to "go with the flow" and trust their intuition
than individuals who are not powerful. See Mario Weick and Ana Guinote,

commitment is the tendency to justify increased investment in a decision
based on the cumulative prior investment, despite new evidence
suggesting that the decision may be wrong and additional costs will not
be offset by additional benefits. Escalation of commitment applies to
individuals, groups, and whole organizations. It was first described by
Barry M. Staw in 1976 with later work by Joel Brockner, Barry Staw,
Dustin J. Sleesman et al., and Helga Drummond. Economists use related
terms like *sunk-cost fallacy* (Arkes and Blumer, 1985) and *lock-in*
(Cantarelli et al., 2010) to describe similar phenomena. Escalation of
commitment is captured in popular expressions such as "Throwing good
money after bad" and "In for a penny, in for a pound." In its original
definition, escalation of commitment is unreflected and nondeliberate.
As with other cognitive biases, people don't know that they are subject
to the bias. However, once you understand the mechanism, it may be used
deliberately. See Barry M. Staw, "Knee-Deep in the Big Muddy: A Study of
Escalating Commitment to a Chosen Course of Action," *Organizational

[39](#chapter002.xhtml#not_87){#notes.xhtml_note_87}. A classic finding
of social psychology is that people try to be at least somewhat
consistent in their words and deeds, so if we make a
commitment---particularly a public commitment---we tend to subsequently
behave in ways consistent with that commitment; see Rosanna E. Guadagno
and Robert B. Cialdini, "Preference for Consistency and Social
Influence: A Review of Current Research Findings," *Social Influence* 5,
no. 3 (2010): 152--63; Robert B. Cialdini, *Influence: The Psychology of
Persuasion,* new and expanded edition (New York: Harper Business, 2021),

conclusions can thus be a helping hand in keeping an open mind.

success in Bilbao was so significant that it gave rise to the phrase
"Bilbao effect" to describe economic revitalization resulting from the
creation of a spectacular new building. But what happened in Bilbao only
repeated what the Sydney Opera House had first done in Sydney, a
precedent that was very much on the minds of Basque officials, who
explicitly asked Gehry to replicate it. So the phenomenon might be
better called the "Sydney effect." Whatever its name, it is rare. Many
cities have tried to replicate it, but outside Sydney and Bilbao, the

engineers concluded that Utzon's original design of the shells could not
be built. Decades later, Frank Gehry's team showed that it could in fact
have been built if Gehry's CATIA 3D design model had been available to
Utzon and his team. The root problem was not that Utzon's design was
unbuildable but that the technology to design and build it had not yet
been developed.

[11](#chapter004.xhtml#not_114){#notes.xhtml_note_114}. It is often
claimed that Jørn Utzon was not invited to the Sydney Opera House
opening ceremony. It's a good story, which is probably why it persists,
including on Wikipedia ("Sydney Opera House," accessed July 9, 2022).
But it is false. Utzon was invited. He declined, however, giving as his
reason that his attendance might cause embarrassment by reopening the
controversy over the building, which would be unfortunate, given the
presence of Queen Elizabeth. The opening should be an occasion for joy
and celebration, not antagonism, Utzon argued. He also wanted to avoid
the media and knew that if he went to Sydney that would be impossible.
He explained that under the circumstances not showing up was the most
diplomatic thing he could do (Drew, *The Masterpiece,* 432--33).
Declining the invitation might have miffed the hosts, however. During my
research, I interviewed staff at the Sydney Opera House. They told me
that for decades after the opening they had been instructed not to
mention Utzon's name when they gave tours of the building (which happens
several times a day). Instead, Peter Hall, the Australian architect
hired to finish the building, was named as the architect. Only in the
1990s, almost thirty years after Utzon had left Australia, did the world
wake up to the neglect and suddenly start showering him with prizes,
including the Wolf Prize in Israel, the Sonning Prize in Denmark, and
the Pritzker Architecture Prize in the United States. Eventually, a kind
of reconciliation was arrived at []{#notes.xhtml_Page_215 .pagebreak
aria-label="215" role="doc-pagebreak"}when the opera house authorities
invited Utzon to prepare design guidelines for future work on the
building and Utzon accepted the invitation in August 1999 on the
condition that his son Jan Utzon represent him in Australia; see ibid.,
xiv--xv.

was originally identified by psychologists as the tendency of

management, I first used the term in my 2014 paper "What You Should Know
About Megaprojects and Why" in *Project Management Journal,* where I
defined uniqueness bias as the tendency of planners and managers to see
their projects as singular. It is a general bias, but it turns out to be
particularly rewarding as an object of study in project management
because project planners and managers are systematically primed to see
their projects as unique; see Bent Flyvbjerg, "What You Should Know

have long tended to divide into two seemingly contradictory schools of
thought on intuition. One school, known as "heuristics and biases" and
led by Daniel Kahneman, relies mostly on laboratory experiments to show
how the fast thinking of intuition can mislead. The other, known as
"naturalistic decision making" (NDM), studies how experienced people
make decisions in workplaces and has shown that intuition can be an
excellent basis for judgments---like an experienced nurse who senses
something is wrong with a newborn baby even though instruments and
protocols suggest that the baby is fine. The psychologist Gary Klein is
the dean of the latter school. In 2009, Kahneman and Klein published a
joint []{#notes.xhtml_Page_218 .pagebreak aria-label="218"
role="doc-pagebreak"}paper that concluded that the two schools are
actually in fundamental agreement. They also outlined the conditions
required for skilled intuition to develop. See Daniel Kahneman and Gary
Klein, "Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree,"
*American Psychologist* 64, no. 6 (September 2009): 515--26. For an
overview of naturalistic decision making and the research on skilled
intuition, see Gary Klein, "A Naturalistic Decision-Making Perspective

[24](#chapter005.xhtml#not_154){#notes.xhtml_note_154}. It should be
emphasized that the cost and schedule overruns on the Walt Disney
Concert Hall were not due to Frank Gehry's lack of planning, although he
was often blamed. Gehry was forced off the Disney Concert Hall project
after the design development phase, when the client decided to give the
project to an executive architect it thought would be better at
producing construction documents and doing construction administration.
The executive architect failed, which was a main cause of the delays and
overruns on the Disney Concert Hall. In fact, when Gehry was later
brought back in, he delivered the Disney Concert Hall on budget,
compared with the budget estimated at the start of construction,
according to Gehry's biographer Paul Goldberger and Stephen Rountree,
president of Music Center, Los Angeles, and owner of the Disney Concert
Hall. See Paul Goldberger, *Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank
Gehry* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2015), 322; Stephen D. Rountree,
"Letter to the Editor, Jan Tuchman, Engineering News Record," Music
Center, Los Angeles, April 1, 2010.

The Walt Disney Concert Hall has a special place in Frank Gehry's career
as his near nemesis and as the project that taught him how to protect
his designs from being undermined by politics and business. The Disney
Concert Hall was Gehry's "near-Utzon experience," in the sense that it
threatened to undo his career, as the Sydney Opera House undid Utzon's.
There was a major difference, however, that saved Gehry, but only just:
When trouble hit Gehry, he could not flee back home as Utzon had,
because he was home already. He lived and worked in Los Angeles, just a
few miles down the freeway from the Disney Concert Hall. As a
consequence, when the project went wrong, he became a pariah in his own
hometown. For years he was hammered by the local press. He could not go
out without being accosted by people, who would blame him for the Disney
Concert Hall debacle or express their sympathy with his unhappy fate,
both of which equally annoyed Gehry. "They were all out to get me here
\[in Los Angeles\] because I'm the local guy," he later explained in an
interview, "so they started a barrage coming at me" (quoted in Frank
Gehry, *Gehry Talks: Architecture + Process,* ed. Mildred Friedman
\[London: Thames & Hudson, []{#notes.xhtml_Page_219 .pagebreak
aria-label="219" role="doc-pagebreak"}2003\], 114). Almost ten years
after the fact, Gehry still called that period the "darkest times" of
his life and said, "I have a lot of wounds from the process"; see Frank
O. Gehry, "Introduction," in *Symphony: Frank Gehry's Walt Disney
Concert Hall,* ed. Gloria Gerace (New York: Harry N. Abrams, 2003), 15.
The nadir came in 1997, when after nine years of work on the Disney
Concert Hall, the political and business leaders in charge tried to oust
Gehry and have someone else complete his designs and drawings. That was
the final straw. For a while Gehry thought the project was over as far
as he was concerned, and he considered leaving Los Angeles altogether.

However, Walt Disney's widow, Lillian Disney, was a main sponsor of the
project, and the Disney family now stepped in with its power and money
on the side of Gehry. The Disney Concert Hall had turned into a scandal,
to be sure, but after the dust settled, Gehry's position in the project
had been strengthened and he was at last in charge of design and the
final drawings. The Disney family's spokesperson, Lillian and Walt
Disney's daughter Diane Disney Miller, issued a statement saying, "We
promised Los Angeles a Frank Gehry building, and that's what we intend
to deliver"; see Richard Koshalek and Dana Hutt, "The Impossible Becomes
Possible: The Making of Walt Disney Concert Hall," in *Symphony,* page
57. Unlike Utzon in Sydney, Gehry had powerful supporters in Los Angeles
who defended him when the attacks got out of hand. That ultimately saved
him and his designs for the Disney Concert Hall.

But Gehry was also lucky regarding his timing. His lowest point with the
Disney Concert Hall happened to coincide with his rise to international
superstardom with the opening in 1997 of the Guggenheim Museum in
Bilbao, Spain. That building was immediately and globally recognized as
a sensation in modern design, moving architecture to new levels of
artistic expression, as mentioned in the main text. Because of the
controversy and delays with the Disney Concert Hall, although the
Guggenheim Bilbao was started three years after the Disney Concert Hall,
it was completed six years before it. The Guggenheim Bilbao therefore
forced the issue with political and business leaders in Los Angeles,
with local media, and with the general public that if Gehry could build
world-class architecture on time and budget in faraway Bilbao, perhaps
he could do the same at home in Los Angeles. Gehry was finally given the
responsibility for completing the Disney Concert Hall, and there were no
new cost overruns and scandals on the \$274 million project from the
time his office took charge until completion in 2003. Just as important,
the Walt Disney Concert Hall was instantly and broadly recognized as
"the most astonishing masterpiece of public architecture ever built in
Los Angeles"; see Koshalek and Hutt, "The Impossible Becomes Possible,"
58.

So is all well that ends well? This is the conventional view of scandal
in architecture. After all, the finished building will typically remain
for a []{#notes.xhtml_Page_220 .pagebreak aria-label="220"
role="doc-pagebreak"}century or more, whereas the hardships and scandals
that went into its making will soon be forgotten. People fall, buildings
stand. From this point of view, projects such as the Walt Disney Concert
Hall and the Sydney Opera House are successes despite the turmoil and
grief they involved. Not to Gehry, however. Here, too, he is
unconventional. His lesson from the Disney Concert Hall was *Never
again!* He was uncomfortably aware that luck and circumstance had saved
him from the fate of Utzon. Never again would he risk his livelihood and
that of his partners. Never again would he endure the abuse and
"darkness" he had been subjected to by the Disney Concert Hall. During
the long gestation process of the hall, Gehry came to see that it is
both unintelligent and unnecessary to take the kind of risks and accept
the kind of mistreatment he had. Cost overruns, delays, controversy,
reputational damage, and placing one's career and business at risk are
not inevitable ingredients in building a masterpiece, Gehry learned.
Slowly---blow by blow at the Disney Concert Hall, triumph by triumph in
Bilbao and elsewhere---it dawned on Gehry that there is a different way
to organize design and construction, where he would stay in control
instead of becoming marginalized and "infantilized," as he calls it.
Gehry coined a term for the new setup he eventually developed: "the
organization of the artist," put in print for the first time in *Harvard
Design Magazine;* see Bent Flyvbjerg, "Design by Deception: The Politics
of Megaproject Approval," *Harvard Design Magazine,* no. 22
(Spring--Summer 2005): 50--59. Gehry has used this setup on every
project since the Disney Concert Hall to deliver sublime architecture on
time and on budget.

[6](#chapter006.xhtml#not_161){#notes.xhtml_note_161}. Anchoring is the
tendency to rely too heavily, or "anchor," on one piece of information
when making decisions. The human brain will anchor on almost anything,
as illustrated in the main text, whether random numbers, previous
experience, or false information. It has proven difficult to avoid this.
Therefore, the most effective way of dealing with anchoring seems to be
not to avoid it but to make sure the brain anchors in relevant
information before making decisions; e.g., in base rates that are
pertinent to the decision at hand. This advice is similar to
recommending that gamblers know the objective odds of the game they play
to increase their chances of winning and limit their losses. It is sound
advice but often goes unheeded. See Timothy D. Wilson et al., "A New

[17](#chapter006.xhtml#not_172){#notes.xhtml_note_172}. If you think
your planned project will be affected by more and bigger unknown
unknowns than the projects in the reference class, you add
contingencies, building in buffers of time or money; again, this is
anchoring and adjustment. For example, if climate change is increasing
flooding risk, that may not be reflected in the reference-class data
because they are historical; therefore your adjustment must be larger
than the reference class indicates. If you think your project will be
less affected than the reference class, you subtract. But be warned:
This will reintroduce subjective judgment to the mix, which risks
reintroducing optimism bias. Careful, self-critical analysis---and
data---are essential.

inclined reader: A power law distribution with an alpha value of 1 or
lower has an infinite (nonexistent) mean. If the alpha value is 2 or
lower, variance is infinite (nonexistent), resulting in unstable sample
means, making forecasting impossible. As a conservative heuristic,
Nassim Nicholas Taleb and his colleagues recommend considering variables
with an alpha value of 2.5 or less as not forecastable in practice. For
such variables, the sample mean will be too unstable and will require
too much data for forecasts to be reliable or even practical. To
illustrate, they mention the fact that 10^14^ observations would be
needed for the sample mean of a Pareto 80/20 distribution, with an alpha
value of 1.13, to be as reliable as the sample mean of just thirty
observations from a Gaussian (normal) distribution; see Nassim Nicholas
Taleb, Yaneer Bar-Yam, and Pasquale Cirillo, "On Single Point Forecasts
for Fat-Tailed Variables," *International Journal of Forecasting* 38
(2022): 413--22. In short, for fat-tailed phenomena, cost-benefit
analysis, risk assessment, and other forecasting will be neither
reliable nor practical.

[23](#chapter006.xhtml#not_178){#notes.xhtml_note_178}. Project planners
and scholars have generally been trained to assume that project
performance follows regression to the mean. This is unfortunate, because
the data do not support the assumption; project performance in fact
follows regression to the tail for many kinds of projects; see
Flyvbjerg, "The Law of Regression to the Tail." Project planners and
managers must therefore understand regression to the tail in order to
deliver their projects successfully.

Sir Francis Galton coined the term *regression to the mean*---or
*regression towards mediocrity,* as he originally called it; see Francis
Galton, "Regression Towards Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature," *The
Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland*
15 (1886), 246--63. It is now a widely used concept in statistics and
statistical modeling, describing how measurements of a sample mean will
tend toward the population mean when done in sufficient numbers,
although there may be large variations in individual measurements.
Galton illustrated his principle by the example that parents who are
tall tend to have children who grow up to be shorter than their parents,
closer to the mean of the population, and vice versa for short parents.
Today we know that Galton's example is flawed, because the height of a
child is not statistically independent of the height of its parents,
[]{#notes.xhtml_Page_226 .pagebreak aria-label="226"
role="doc-pagebreak"}due to genetics unknown to Galton. Nevertheless, we
understand what Galton was trying to prove, and it turns out that he was
right. In a statistically more correct example of Galton's principle,
with statistically independent events, a roulette wheel with a 50:50
chance of red or black can show red five times in a row---in fact, it
will do this in 3 percent of any five consecutive spins of the
wheel---yet the odds are 50:50 for red versus black in ensuing spins.
Therefore, the more spins of the wheel that are done, the closer the
outcome will be to 50:50 red to black, even when one starts with five
consecutive reds. When done in large numbers, the average outcome of
spins regresses to its expected mean as the number is increased, no
matter what the starting point was.

There is nothing as practical as a theory that is correct. Regression to
the mean has been proven mathematically for many types of statistics,
and it is highly useful in health, insurance, and schools, on factory
floors, in casinos, and in risk management; e.g., for flight safety.
Much of statistics and statistical modeling builds on regression to the
mean, including the law of large numbers, sampling, standard deviations,
and conventional tests of statistical significance. Anyone who has done
a basic statistics course has been trained in regression to the mean,
whether they are aware of it or not. But regression to the mean
presupposes that a population mean exists. For some random events of
great consequence, this is not the case.

For example, the size distributions of earthquakes, floods, wildfires,
pandemics, wars, and terrorist attacks have no population mean, or the
mean is ill defined due to infinite variance. In other words, mean and
variance do not exist. Regression to the mean is a meaningless concept
for such phenomena, whereas regression to the tail is meaningful and
consequential. A distribution must have a nonvanishing probability
density toward infinity (or minus infinity) for regression to the tail
to occur in data sampled from it. This nonvanishing probability density
toward infinity looks like a tail on a graph of the distribution.
Regression to the tail occurs only for distributions with infinite
variance. The frequency of new extremes and the amount by which a new
extreme exceeds the previous extreme indicate whether the underlying
distribution that data are sampled from has an expected value and finite
variance, or infinite variance and hence no well-defined expected value.
In the latter case, "regression to the mean" means regression to
infinity; i.e., there *is* no mean value in the conventional sense. Ever
better attempts to estimate the mean with conventional methods (i.e., by
the mean values of a sample) will yield ever larger values, which is to
say values in the tail.

I have named this phenomenon---that events appear in the tail in
sufficient size and frequency for the mean *not* to converge---"the law
of regression to the tail"; see Flyvbjerg, 2020, "The Law of Regression
to the Tail." The law depicts a situation with extreme events, and no
matter how extreme []{#notes.xhtml_Page_227 .pagebreak aria-label="227"
role="doc-pagebreak"}the most extreme event is, there will always be an
event even more extreme. It is only a matter of time (or a larger
sample) until it appears. Earthquake size is an archetypical example of
a phenomenon that follows the law of regression to the tail. So are
forest fires and floods. But the law applies not only to extreme natural
and social phenomena. My data show that it applies to everyday project
planning and management, too, from ordinary IT projects to Olympic Games
to nuclear power plants and big dams; see Bent Flyvbjerg et al., "The
Empirical Reality of IT Project Cost Overruns: Discovering a Power-Law
Distribution," accepted for publication in *Journal of Management
Information Systems* 39, no. 3 (Fall 2022); Bent Flyvbjerg, Alexander
Budzier, and Daniel Lunn, 2021, "Regression to the Tail: Why the
Olympics Blow Up," *Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space* 53,
no. 2 (March 2021): 233--60. Or to put the matter differently: Project
planning and management behave like extreme natural and social
phenomena, although planners and managers largely ignore this and treat
projects as if they abide by regression to the mean, which in and of
itself goes a long way toward explaining the dismal performance of most
projects.

[24](#chapter006.xhtml#not_179){#notes.xhtml_note_179}. This is where
the standard 10 to 15 percent contingency that is found in much
conventional project management comes from. It builds on the assumption
of a normal distribution. But this assumption is typically not met in
reality, as explained in the main text. The assumption is therefore
generally misguided.

level of insurance against overrun a client has ever asked my team and
me to model is 95 percent, which resulted in humongous contingencies.
This is because the marginal cost of insurance increases with the level
of insurance. The client wanted to be *really* safe for political
reasons. Under normal circumstances, I do not recommend insurance above
[]{#notes.xhtml_Page_228 .pagebreak aria-label="228"
role="doc-pagebreak"}approximately 80 percent for big stand-alone
projects such as XRL, because it's simply too expensive and the funds an
organization sets aside for contingencies cannot be used for more
productive purposes elsewhere in the organization. For portfolio
managers who are responsible for many projects I recommend an even lower
level, closer to the mean in the reference class, because the losses on
some projects in the portfolio can then be offset by gains on others.

[10](#chapter007.xhtml#not_197){#notes.xhtml_note_197}. This is the
story as related by Hirschman. In fact, the paper mill in Bangladesh and
several other projects that Hirschman described as successes, saved by
the Hiding Hand, turned out to be disasters. The mill operated at a loss
throughout the 1970s, becoming a drag on the national economy instead of
the boost Hirschman had predicted just years before. The Paz del Río
steel mill in Colombia is another example of a major project admired by
Hirschman in which the Hiding Hand triggered financial disaster instead
of creative solutions. Finally, Nigeria's three-hundred-mile-long
[]{#notes.xhtml_Page_229 .pagebreak aria-label="229"
role="doc-pagebreak"}Bornu Railway catalyzed an ethnic conflict that led
to secession and a tragic civil war, with hunger and starvation and
killings in breakaway Biafra from 1967 to 1970. Privately, it disturbed
Hirschman that he had failed to see that a project he had just studied
and pronounced a success could have such disastrous consequences so
shortly after. But curiously, nowhere does this failure or the fact that
project outcomes seemed to run counter to the principle of the Hiding
Hand cause Hirschman to critically assess and revise the principle, not
even when he wrote a new preface to a later edition of *Development
Projects Observed* or when a group of prominent scholars invited him to
reflect on the principle. For the full story, with full references, see

Denmark. But they were minor compared with the Sydney Opera House.
Internationally (and in Denmark), Utzon is known almost exclusively for
the Sydney Opera House. I've asked the question "Can you name a building
other than the Sydney Opera House that Jørn Utzon designed?" of at least
a thousand people in my lectures on the subject. Very few can, and they
are almost always Danish or professional architects or both.

allowed another T5 innovation: rehearsal. When construction of the main
terminal building at an airport in Hong Kong suffered a long delay,
impacting the entire project, T5 managers decided that they would take
the many workers who would erect the T5 main building and the components
the workers would assemble to a site in the English countryside. There
they practiced the assembly. That rehearsal led to the discovery of
challenges and the development of solutions long before the real
assembly at Heathrow. It wasn't cheap. But the cost was a fraction of
what it would have been if the problems had first surfaced at the
worksite and delayed the project.

the plant in 1982. Toyota, which had no North American manufacturing
capability at the time, proposed a joint venture that would see the
plant reopen and operate using the same machinery and mostly the same
workers. But Toyota would manage using its methods, which famously
respected and empowered workers. Morale soared; absenteeism and turnover
plunged. Production quality improved dramatically, and productivity
soared so much []{#notes.xhtml_Page_231 .pagebreak aria-label="231"

students, many of whom are executives in charge of big projects, to
tunnel like Madrid, should they ever find themselves leading a rail,
road, water, or other project requiring extensive tunneling. For most,
treating tunnels as Lego comes as an epiphany, because tunneling, like
other digging, is conventionally seen as archetypically bespoke. I have
literally had students walk straight out of my class on the Madrid Metro
and place a call to order additional boring machines for their projects.
Each machine typically costs between \$20 million and \$40 million,
depending on size and type, which is cheap, considering the time and
money multiple machines save.

mathematical/statistical terms, the degree of fat-tailedness was
measured by the alpha-value of a power law fit to the cost overrun data
for each project type. Projects with an alpha value of four or below
were considered fat-tailed. Similar results were found for schedule and
benefits. These conclusions apply to my current data set. With my team,
I'm constantly growing the data, and results may change as more data are
collected. The results should be considered preliminary in this sense.

*The Guardian,* October 13, 2020. Using the conservative numbers from
Flyvbjerg, *Oxford Handbook of Megaproject Management* (2017)---that is,
\$6 trillion to \$9 trillion per year---a 5 percent cost cut would equal
savings of \$300 billion to \$450 billion per year. Using Frey's
"Megaprojects Set to Explode" (2017) number---\$22 trillion invested per
year---the savings would be \$1.1 trillion per year. With a 30 percent
cost cut, the savings would be \$1.8 trillion to \$2.7 trillion and
\$6.6 trillion, respectively. And finally, at 80 percent, which assumes
significant technological innovation, some of which is already
happening, the savings would be \$4.8 trillion to \$7.2 trillion per
year and \$17.6 trillion per year for the Flyvbjerg and Frey numbers,
respectively. These numbers do not include increases in the efficiency
of benefits delivery, which would add further substantial gains on top
of the cost savings.

[37](#chapter009.xhtml#not_254){#notes.xhtml_note_254}. Electrification
is one of two dominant megatrends in the world today. Digitalization is
the other, and it is interesting to compare the two. Both trends are
delivered through tens of thousands of projects, big and small, year in
and year out, decade after decade, in every area of the world. However,
there is a fundamental difference between the two trends and the two
types of projects in terms of performance and management.
Electrification projects, not including nuclear and hydroelectric power
projects, are at one end of the scale, with high-quality performance and
management in terms of cost and schedule overruns that are few and
small. Digitalization projects are at the other end of the scale, with
low-quality performance in terms of cost and schedule overruns, which
tend to be huge and unpredictable. In my analysis, low-quality project
management---and *not* problems with digital technology---is *the* key
problem for current digitalization. It's the elephant in the room for
all things digital, widely ignored despite being hugely costly and
wasteful. In contrast, high-quality project management is key to the
massive global success of electrification, especially for wind power,
solar power, batteries, and transmission. This is fortunate, because if
we quickly scale up the current trend for well-managed electrification,
we might just save ourselves from the worst of the climate crisis, as
explained in the main text. In any case, IT project managers have much
to learn from their []{#notes.xhtml_Page_236 .pagebreak aria-label="236"

### CODA: ELEVEN HEURISTICS FOR BETTER PROJECT LEADERSHIP {.author-head2}

[1](#chapter010.xhtml#not_262){#notes.xhtml_note_262}. Oxford English
Dictionary 2022: full entry,
<https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/86554?isAdvanced=false&result=1&rskey=WrJUIh&>.

[2](#chapter010.xhtml#not_263){#notes.xhtml_note_263}. Gerd Gigerenzer,
Ralph Hertwig, and Thorsten Pachur, eds., *Heuristics: The Foundations
of Adaptive Behavior* (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2011).

[3](#chapter010.xhtml#not_264){#notes.xhtml_note_264}. Today, two main
schools exist in thinking about heuristics. The first focuses on
"positive heuristics," defined as heuristics that help people make
better decisions, such as the recognition heuristic and the
take-the-best heuristic; see Gerd Gigerenzer and Daniel G. Goldstein,
"Reasoning the Fast and Frugal Way: Models of Bounded Rationality,"
*Psychological Review* 103, no. 4 (1996): 650--69; Gerd Gigerenzer,
"Models of Ecological Rationality: The Recognition Heuristic,"
*Psychological Review* 109, no. 1 (2002): 75--90. Gerd Gigerenzer is the
leading proponent of this school. The second school concentrates on
"negative heuristics," defined as heuristics that trip up
[]{#notes.xhtml_Page_237 .pagebreak aria-label="237"
role="doc-pagebreak"}people, violating basic laws of rationality and
logic; e.g., the availability heuristic and the anchoring heuristic; see
Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, "Availability: A Heuristic for Judging
Frequency and Probability," *Cognitive Psychology* 5, no. 2 (September
1973): 207--32; Daniel Kahneman, "Reference Points, Anchors, Norms, and
Mixed Feelings," *Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes*
51, no. 2 (1992): 296--312. Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky are the
leading exponents of this school. Both schools have demonstrated their
relevance in impressive detail. Important disagreements exist between
the two, to be sure; see Gerd Gigerenzer, "The Bias Bias in Behavioral
Economics," *Review of Behavioral Economics* 5, nos. 3--4 (December
2018): 303--36; Daniel Kahneman and Gary Klein, "Conditions for
Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree," *American Psychologist* 64,
no. 6 (2009): 515--26. But they are best understood as complementary
models for understanding different aspects of heuristics, not as
competing models for explaining the same thing. In short, you need to
understand both schools of thought to fully understand the role of
heuristics in human adaptive behavior, which is to understand human
existence. Chapter 2 covered central aspects of negative heuristics,
their impact on decision making, and how they may be mitigated. This
coda focuses on positive heuristics and especially on how they pertain
to successfully leading and delivering projects.

[4](#chapter010.xhtml#not_265){#notes.xhtml_note_265}. For a longer and
more detailed list of my heuristics, including deeper explanations of
what heuristics are, why they work, and how to tease them out, with more
examples, see Bent Flyvbjerg, "Heuristics for Masterbuilders: Fast and
